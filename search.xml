      <content type="text"><![CDATA[做了这么久的电商，最近离开公司，我不想下家公司问我“电商是什么？” 只能憨憨的回答一句”就是妇联网卖假药的”.mdzz，不能这么直白，作为一名致力于向”高鸡程序员”迈进的sb，小白问我是干什么的时候，我可以回答的让他错误的以为我是“砖家”。如果是技术大牛问我的话，我也会忽悠他让他觉得”这小子可以啊，可以和我KO啊“ 为了达到这样的效果，从29号下午起，我就开始做一个‘高大上’的电商项目，我不是平白无故的装13，我是有目的的，嘿嘿嘿。也就是说现在已经敲了三天两夜代码了，框架已经搭好了，利用现在空挡时间“开开车”。全程独立完成，别他妈的问我技术，早就戒了，只会cc和cv。我的座右铭是：“你可以怀疑我的gender，但是千万别怀疑我的技术”。我的项目一个字“牛”，要是我的项目让一个项目组开发的话，也许工作量就没啥吹的。关键是”全程一个人“，真是上厕所的时间都省了。吹了半天，说说我的项目吧。首先要说的意思就是，一个大的企业的网站架构是什么？我不想废话，我是很明白，谁要不会可以谷歌一下，让你明明白白的，我只给下面一张图： 这个项目解决了大企业高并发访问的问题，也设计了一套企业级高可用（HA）的数据库级别的解决方案。现在只是刚把项目搭建起来。在完成项目的时候预计会遇到许许多多的问题，我不会害怕，我相信凭借我的技术，解决这样那样的未知错误和bug不成问题。后续有空我会一一把开发中遇到的比较棘手的问题列举出来。然后有利于以后开发更加高效给力。下面是我完成项目的截图：目前开发商品下的品牌模块，]]></content>

Who could your lover be?Hey! Who could your lover be?Let me eat off his head so you can really see!Ten thousand women all dressed in white,Ten thousand women all dressed in white,Standin’ at my window wishing me goodnight.Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,Each one of ‘em got seven wives, each one of ‘em just out of jail.Ten thousand women all sweepin’ my room,Ten thousand women all sweepin’ my room,Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea!Baby, thank you for my tea!It’s so sweet of you to be so nice to me. 2x2One by one, they followed the sun,One by one, until there were none.Two by two, to their lovers they flew,Two by two, into the foggy dew.Three by three, they danced on the sea,Four by four, they danced on the shore,Five by five, they tried to survive,Six by six, they were playing with tricks.Bridge #1:How many paths did they try and fail?How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?How much poison did they inhale?How many black cats crossed their trail?Seven by seven, they headed for heaven,Eight by eight, they got to the gate,Nine by nine, they drank the wine,Ten by ten, they drank again.Bridge #2:How many tomorrow’s have are they given away?How many compared to yesterday?How many more without any reward?How many more can they afford?Two by two, they stepped into the ark,Two by two, they step in the dark.Three by three, they’re turning the key,Four by four, they turn it some more,One by one, they follow the sun,Two by two, to another rendezvous 4th Time AroundWhen she said,“Don’t waste your words, they’re just lies,”I cried she was deaf.And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes,Then said, “What else you got left?”It was then that I got up to leaveBut she said, “Don’t forget,Everybody must give something backFor something they get.” I stood there and hummed,I tapped on her drum and asked her how come.And she buttoned her boot,And straightened her suit,Then she said, “Don’t get cute.”So I forced my hands in my pocketsAnd felt with my thumbs,And gallantly handed herMy very last piece of gum. She threw me outside,I stood in the dirt where ev’ryone walked.And after finding I’dForgotten my shirt,I went back and knocked.I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,And I tried to make senseOut of that picture of you in your wheelchairThat leaned up against . . . Her Jamaican rumAnd when she did come, I asked her for some.She said, “No, dear.”I said, “Your words aren’t clear,You’d better spit out your gum.”She screamed till her face got so redThen she fell on the floor,And I covered her up and thenThought I’d go look through her drawer. And, when I was throughI filled up my shoeAnd brought it to you.And you, you took me in,You loved me thenYou didn’t waste time.And I, I never took much,I never asked for your crutch.Now don’t ask for mine. A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna FallOh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?I’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,I’ve walked and I’ve crawled on six crooked highways,I’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,I’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard,And it’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall.Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around itI saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin’,I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin’,I saw a white ladder all covered with water,I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard,And it’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall.And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?And what did you hear, my darling young one?I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin’,Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin’,Heard ten thousand whisperin’ and nobody listenin’,Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin’,Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard,And it’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall.Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?Who did you meet, my darling young one?I met a young child beside a dead pony,I met a white man who walked a black dog,I met a young woman whose body was burning,I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow,I met one man who was wounded in loveI met another man who was wounded with hatred,And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard,It’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall.Oh, what’ll you do now, my blue-eyed son?Oh, what’ll you do now, my darling young one?I’m a-goin’ back out ‘fore the rain starts a-fallin’,I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest,Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison,Where the executioner’s face is always well hidden,Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten,Where black is the color, where none is the number,And I’ll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it,And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it,Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin’,But I’ll know my song well before I start singin’,And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard,It’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall.Absolutely Sweet MarieWell, your railroad gate, you know I just can’t jump itSometimes it gets so hard, you seeI’m just sitting here beating on my trumpetWith all these promises you left for meBut where are you tonight, sweet Marie?Well, I waited for you when I was half sickYes, I waited for you when you hated meWell, I waited for you inside of the frozen trafficWhen you knew I had some other place to beNow, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?Well, anybody can be just like me, obviouslyBut then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately.Well, six white horses that you did promiseWere fin’lly delivered down to the penitentiaryBut to live outside the law, you must be honestI know you always say that you agreeBut where are you tonight, sweet Marie?Well, I don’t know how it happenedBut the river-boat captain, he knows my fateBut ev’rybody else, even yourselfThey’re just gonna have to wait.Well, I got the fever down in my pocketsThe Persian drunkard, he follows meYes, I can take him to your house but I can’t unlock itYou see, you forgot to leave me with the keyOh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?Now, I been in jail when all my mail showedThat a man can’t give his address out to bad companyAnd now I stand here lookin’ at your yellow railroadIn the ruins of your balconyWond’ring where you are tonight, sweet Marie. Abandoned LoveI can hear the turning of the keyI’ve been deceived by the clown inside of me.I thought that he was righteous but he’s vainOh, something’s a-telling me I wear the ball and chain.My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghostHe’s always off somewhere when I need him most.The Spanish moon is rising on the hillBut my heart is a-tellin’ me I love ya still.I come back to the town from the flaming moonI see you in the streets, I begin to swoon.I love to see you dress before the mirrorWon’t you let me in your room one time ‘fore I finally disappear?Everybody’s wearing a disguiseTo hide what they’ve got left behind their eyes.But me, I can’t cover what I amWherever the children go I’ll follow them.I march in the parade of libertyBut as long as I love you I’m not free.How long must I suffer such abuseWon’t you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose?I’ve given up the game, I’ve got to leave,The pot of gold is only make-believe.The treasure can’t be found by men who searchWhose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list.My head tells me it’s time to make a changeBut my heart is telling me I love ya but you’re strange.One more time at midnight, near the wallTake off your heavy make-up and your shawl.Won’t you descend from the throne, from where you sit?Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it. Ain’t A-Gonna GrieveWell, I ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no moreAin’t a-gonna grieve no more, no moreAin’t a-gonna grieve no more, no moreAnd ain’t a-gonna grieve no more.Come on brother, join the band,Come on sisters, clap your hands,Tell everybody that’s in the land,You ain’t a-gonna grieve no more.Well, I ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no moreAin’t a-gonna grieve no more, no moreAin’t a-gonna grieve no more, no moreAnd ain’t a-gonna grieve no more.Brown and blue and white and black,All one color on the one-way track,We got this far and ain’t a-goin’ backAnd ain’t a-gonna grieve no more.Well, I ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no moreAin’t a-gonna grieve no more, no moreAin’t a-gonna grieve no more, no moreI ain’t a-gonna grieve no more.We’re gonna notify your next of kin,You’re gonna raise the roof until the house falls in.If you get knocked down get up again,We ain’t a-gonna grieve no more.Well, I ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no moreAin’t a-gonna grieve no more, no moreAin’t a-gonna grieve no more, no moreI ain’t a-gonna grieve no more.We’ll sing this song all night long,Sing it to my baby from midnight on.She’ll sing it to you when I’m dead and gone,Ain’t a-gonna grieve no more.Well, I ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no moreAin’t a-gonna grieve no more, no moreAin’t a-gonna grieve no more, no moreI ain’t a-gonna grieve no more. Ain’t No Man Righteous (No Not One)When a man he serves the Lord, it makes his life worthwhile.It don’t matter ‘bout his position, it don’t matter ‘bout his lifestyle.Talk about perfection, I ain’t never seen noneAnd there ain’t no man righteous, no not one.Sometimes the devil likes to drive you from the neighborhood.He’ll even work his ways through those whose intentions are good.Some like to worship on the moon, others are worshipping the sunAnd there ain’t no man righteous, no not one.Look around, ya see so many social hypocritesLike to make rules for others while they do just the opposite.You can’t get to glory by the raising and the lowering of no flag.Put your goodness next to God’s and it comes out like a filthy rag.In a city of darkness there’s no need of the sunAnd there ain’t no man righteous, no not one.Done so many evil things in the name of love, it’s a crying shameI never did see no fire that could put out a flame.Pull your hat down, baby, pull the wool down over your eyes,Keep a-talking, baby, ‘til you run right out of alibis.Someday you’ll account for all the deeds that you done.Well, there ain’t no man righteous, no not one.God got the power, man has got his vanity,Man gotta choose before God can set him free.Don’t you know there’s nothing new that’s under the sun?Well, there ain’t no man righteous, no not one.When I’m gone don’t wonder where I be.Just say that I trusted in God and that Christ was in me.Say He defeated the devil, He was God’s chosen SonAnd that there ain’t no man righteous, no not one.

Arthur McBride, by Bob Dylan (arr)Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,As we went a-walkin’ down by the seaside,Mark now what followed and what did betide,For it bein’ on Christmas mornin’Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp,And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal VampAnd a little wee drummer intending to camp,For the day bein’ pleasant and charmin’. “Good morning, good morning,” the Sergeant he cried.“And the same to you, gentlemen,” we did reply,Intending no harm but meant to pass by,For it bein’ on Christmas mornin’“But,” says he, “My fine fellows, if you will enlist,Ten guineas in gold I’ll stick to your fist,And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust,And drink the king’s health in the morning. “For a soldier, he leads a very fine life,And he always is blessed with a charming young wife,And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife,And he always lives pleasant and charmin’,And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,In the finest of clothing he’s constantly seen.While other poor fellows go dirty and mean,And sup on thin gruel in the morning.”Instrumental “But,” says Arthur, “I wouldn’t be proud of your clothes,For you’ve only the lend of them, as I suppose,But you dare not change them one night, for you knowIf you do, you’ll be flogged in the morning,And although that we’re single and free,We take great delight in our own company,We have no desire strange places to see,Although that your offers are charming. “And we have no desire to take your advance,All hazards and dangers we barter on chance,For you’d have no scruples for to send us to France,Where we would get shot without warning,”“Oh no,” says the Sergeant. “I’ll have no such chat,And neither will I take it from snappy young brats,For if you insult me with one other word,I’ll cut off your heads in the morning.” And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,And we scarce gave them time to draw their own bladesWhen a trusty shillelagh came over their headAnd bid them take that as fair warning.And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,We flung them as far as we could in the tide,“Now take them up, devils!” cried Arthur McBride,“And temper their edge in the mornin’!” And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow,And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll,And bade it a tedious returning,And we havin’ no money, paid them off in cracks.We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks,And left them for dead in the morning. And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits,For we were the lads who would give them hard cloutsAnd bid them look sharp in the mornin’.Instrumental Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,As we went a-walkin’ down by the seaside,Mark now what followed and what did betide,For it bein’ on Christmas mornin’ As I Went Out One MorningAs I went out one morningTo breathe the air around Tom Paine’s,I spied the fairest damselThat ever did walk in chains.I offer’d her my hand,She took me by the arm.I knew that very instant,She meant to do me harm.“Depart from me this moment,”I told her with my voice.Said she, “But I don’t wish to,”Said I, “But you have no choice.”“I beg you, sir,” she pleadedFrom the corners of her mouth,“I will secretly accept youAnd together we’ll fly south.”Just then Tom Paine, himself,Came running from across the field,Shouting at this lovely girlAnd commanding her to yield.And as she was letting go her grip,Up Tom Paine did run,“I’m sorry, sir,” he said to me,“I’m sorry for what she’s done.” Baby, I’m in the Mood for YouSometimes I’m in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome homeAnd sometimes I’m in the mood, I wanna hear my milk cow moanAnd sometimes I’m in the mood, I wanna hit the highway roadBut then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I saidOh babe, I’m in the mood for you.Sometimes I’m in the mood, Lord, I had my overflowin’ fillSometimes I’m in the mood, I’m gonna make out my final willSometimes I’m in the mood, I’m gonna head for the walkin’ hillBut then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I saidOh babe, I’m in the mood for you.Sometimes I’m in the mood, I wanna lay right down and dieSometimes I’m in the mood, I wanna climb up to the skySometimes I’m in the mood, I’m gonna laugh until I cryBut then again, I said again, I said again, I saidOh babe, I’m in the mood for you.Sometimes I’m in the mood, I’m gonna sleep in my pony’s stallSometimes I’m in the mood, I ain’t gonna do nothin’ at allSometimes I’m in the mood, I wanna fly like a cannon ballBut then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I saidOh babe, I’m in the mood for you.Sometimes I’m in the mood, I wanna back up against the wallSometimes I’m in the mood, I wanna run till I have to crawlSometimes I’m in the mood, I ain’t gonna do nothin’ at allBut then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I saidOh babe, I’m in the mood for you.Sometimes I’m in the mood, I wanna change my house aroundSometimes I’m in the mood, I’m gonna make a change in this here townSometimes I’m in the mood, I’m gonna change the world aroundBut then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I saidOh babe, I’m in the mood for you.

Ballad For A FriendSad I’m sittin’ on the railroad track,Watchin’ that old smokestack.Train is a-leavin’ bit it won’t be back.Years ago we hung around,Watchin’ trains roll through the town.Now that train is a-graveyard bound.Where we go up in that North Country,Lakes and streams and mines so free,I had no better friend than he.Something happened to him that day,I thought I heard a stranger say,I hung my head and stole away.A diesel truck was rollin’ slow,Pullin’ down a heavy load.It left him on a Utah road.They carried him back to his home town,His mother cried, his sister moaned,Listin’ to them church bells tone. Ballad in Plain DI once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze.With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.I courted her proudly but now she is gone,Gone as the season she’s taken.Through young summer’s breeze, I stole her awayFrom her mother and sister, though close did they stay.Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.Of the two sisters, I loved the young.With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.The constant scapegoat, she was easily undoneBy the jealousy of others around her.For her parasite sister, I had no respect,Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect.Countless visions of the other she’d reflectAs a crutch for her scenes and her society.Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused,The changes I was going through can’t even be used,For the lies that I told her in hopes not to loseThe could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my gripA magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,Noticing not that I’d already slippedTo a sin of love’s false security.From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies,Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, “Please,What’s wrong and what’s exactly the matter?”And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,The timeless explosion of fantasy’s dream.At the peak of the night, the king and the queenTumbled all down into pieces.“The tragic figure!” her sister did shout,“Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!”And I in my armor, turning aboutAnd nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness.Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did poundHer sister and I in a screaming battleground.And she in between, the victim of sound,Soon shattered as a child ‘neath her shadows.All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight.I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight.My mind it was mangled, I ran into the nightLeaving all of love’s ashes behind me.The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet.The words to say I’m sorry, I haven’t found yet.I think of her often and hope whoever she’s metWill be fully aware of how precious she is.Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,“How good, how good does it feel to be free?”And I answer them most mysteriously,“Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?” Ballad of a Thin ManYou walk into the roomWith your pencil in your handYou see somebody nakedAnd you say, “Who is that man?”You try so hardBut you don’t understandJust what you’ll sayWhen you get homeBecause something is happening hereBut you don’t know what it isDo you, Mister Jones?You raise up your headAnd you ask, “Is this where it is?”And somebody points to you and says“It’s his”And you say, “What’s mine?”And somebody else says, “Where what is?”And you say, “Oh my GodAm I here all alone?”Because something is happening hereBut you don’t know what it isDo you, Mister Jones?You hand in your ticketAnd you go watch the geekWho immediately walks up to youWhen he hears you speakAnd says, “How does it feelTo be such a freak?”And you say, “Impossible”As he hands you a boneBecause something is happening hereBut you don’t know what it isDo you, Mister Jones?You have many contactsAmong the lumberjacksTo get you factsWhen someone attacks your imaginationBut nobody has any respectAnyway they already expect youTo just give a checkTo tax-deductible charity organizationsYou’ve been with the professorsAnd they’ve all liked your looksWith great lawyers you haveDiscussed lepers and crooksYou’ve been through all ofF. Scott Fitzgerald’s booksYou’re very well readIt’s well knownBecause something is happening hereBut you don’t know what it isDo you, Mister Jones?Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to youAnd then he kneelsHe crosses himselfAnd then he clicks his high heelsAnd without further noticeHe asks you how it feelsAnd he says, “Here is your throat backThanks for the loan”Because something is happening hereBut you don’t know what it isDo you, Mister Jones?Now you see this one-eyed midgetShouting the word “NOW”And you say, “For what reason?”And he says, “How?”And you say, “What does this mean?”And he screams back, “You’re a cowGive me some milkOr else go home”Because something is happening hereBut you don’t know what it isDo you, Mister Jones?Well, you walk into the roomLike a camel and then you frownYou put your eyes in your pocketAnd your nose on the groundThere ought to be a lawAgainst you comin’ aroundYou should be madeTo wear earphonesBecause something is happening hereBut you don’t know what it isDo you, Mister Jones? Ballad Of Donald WhiteMy name is Donald White, you see,I stand before you all.I was judged by you a murdererAnd the hangman’s knot must fall.I will die upon the gallows poleWhen the moon is shining clear,And these are my final wordsThat you will ever hear.I left my home in KansasWhen I was very young,I landed in the old Northwest,Seattle, WashingtonAlthough I’d a-traveled many miles,I never made a friend,For I could never get along in lifeWith people that I met.If I had some educationTo give me a decent start,I might have been a doctor orA master in the arts.But I used my hands for stealingWhen I was very young,And they locked me down in jailhouse cells,That’s how my life begun.Oh, the inmates and the prisoners,I found they were my kind,And it was there inside the barsI found my peace of mind.But the jails they were too crowded,Institutions overflowed,So they turned me loose to walk uponLife’s hurried tangled road.And there’s danger on the oceanWhere the salt sea waves split high,And there’s danger on the battlefieldWhere the shells of bullets fly,And there’s danger in this open worldWhere men strive to be free,And for me the greatest dangerWas in society.So I asked them to send me backTo the institution home.But they said they were too crowded,For me they had no room.I got down on my knees and begged,“Oh, please put me away,”But they would not listen to my pleaOr nothing I would say.And so it was on Christmas eveIn the year of ‘59,It was on that night I killed a man,I did not try to hide,The jury found me guiltyAnd I won’t disagree,For I knew that it would happenIf I wasn’t put away.And I’m glad I’ve had no parentsTo care for me or cry,For now they will never knowThe horrible death I die.And I’m also glad I’ve had no friendsTo see me in disgrace,For they’ll never see that hangman’s hoodWrap around my face.Farewell unto the old north woodsOf which I used to roam,Farewell unto the crowded barsOf which’ve been my home,Farewell to all you peopleWho think the worst of me,I guess you’ll feel much better whenI’m on that hanging tree.But there’s just one questionBefore they kill me dead,I’m wondering just how muchTo you I really saidConcerning all the boys that comeDown a road like me,Are they enemies or victimsOf your society?

Black Diamond Bay, by Bob Dylan and Jacques LevyUp on the white verandaShe wears a necktie and a Panama hat.Her passport shows a faceFrom another time and placeShe looks nothin’ like that.And all the remnants of her recent pastAre scattered in the wild wind.She walks across the marble floorWhere a voice from the gambling room is callin’ her to come on in.She smiles, walks the other wayAs the last ship sails and the moon fades awayFrom Black Diamond Bay.As the mornin’ light breaks open, the Greek comes downAnd he asks for a rope and a pen that will write.“Pardon, monsieur,” the desk clerk says,Carefully removes his fez,“Am I hearin’ you right?”And as the yellow fog is liftin’The Greek is quickly headin’ for the second floor.She passes him on the spiral staircaseThinkin’ he’s the Soviet Ambassador,She starts to speak, but he walks awayAs the storm clouds rise and the palm branches swayOn Black Diamond Bay.A soldier sits beneath the fanDoin’ business with a tiny man who sells him a ring.Lightning strikes, the lights blow out.The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout,“Can you see anything?”Then the Greek appears on the second floorIn his bare feet with a rope around his neck,While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle,Says, “Open up another deck.”But the dealer says, “Attendez-vous, s’il vous plait,’’As the rain beats down and the cranes fly awayFrom Black Diamond Bay.The desk clerk heard the woman laughAs he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough.He tried to grab the woman’s hand,Said, “Here’s a ring, it cost a grand.”She said, “That ain’t enough.”Then she ran upstairs to pack her bagsWhile a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb.She passed the door that the Greek had locked,Where a handwritten sign read, “Do Not Disturb.”She knocked upon it anywayAs the sun went down and the music did playOn Black Diamond Bay.“I’ve got to talk to someone quick!”But the Greek said, “Go away,” and he kicked the chair to the floor.He hung there from the chandelier.She cried, “Help, there’s danger nearPlease open up the door!”Then the volcano eruptedAnd the lava flowed down from the mountain high above.The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the cornerThinking of forbidden love.But the desk clerk said, “It happens every day,”As the stars fell down and the fields burned awayOn Black Diamond Bay.As the island slowly sankThe loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.The dealer said, “It’s too late now.You can take your money, but I don’t know howYou’ll spend it in the tomb.”The tiny man bit the soldier’s earAs the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,While she’s out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her,“My darling, je vous aime beaucoup.”She sheds a tear and then begins to prayAs the fire burns on and the smoke drifts awayFrom Black Diamond Bay.I was sittin’ home alone one night in L.A.,Watchin’ old Cronkite on the seven o’clock news.It seems there was an earthquake thatLeft nothin’ but a Panama hatAnd a pair of old Greek shoes.Didn’t seem like much was happenin’,So I turned it off and went to grab another beer.Seems like every time you turn aroundThere’s another hard-luck story that you’re gonna hearAnd there’s really nothin’ anyone can sayAnd I never did plan to go anywayTo Black Diamond Bay.

Bob Dylan’s DreamWhile riding on a train goin’ west,I fell asleep for to take my rest.I dreamed a dream that made me sad,Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.With half-damp eyes I stared to the roomWhere my friends and I spent many an afternoon,Where we together weathered many a storm,Laughin’ and singin’ till the early hours of the morn.By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,Our words were told, our songs were sung,Where we longed for nothin’ and were quite satisfiedTalkin’ and a-jokin’ about the world outside.With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,We never thought we could ever get old.We thought we could sit forever in funBut our chances really was a million to one.As easy it was to tell black from white,It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.And our choices were few and the thought never hitThat the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.How many a year has passed and gone,And many a gamble has been lost and won,And many a road taken by many a friend,And each one I’ve never seen again.I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,That we could sit simply in that room again.Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,I’d give it all gladly if our lives could be like that. Bob Dylan’s New Orleans RagI was sittin’ on a stumpDown in New Orleans,I was feelin’ kinda low down,Dirty and mean.Along came a fellaAnd he didn’t even ask.He says, “I know of a womanThat can fix you up fast.”I didn’t think twice,I said like I should,“Let’s go find this ladyThat can do me some good.”We walked across the riverOn a sailin’ spreeAnd we came to a doorCalled one-oh-three.I was just about readyTo give it a little knockWhen out comes a fellaWho couldn’t even walk.He’s linkin’ and a-slinkin’,Couldn’t stand on his feet,And he moaned and he groanedAnd he shuffled down the street.Well, out of the doorThere comes another man.He wiggled and he wobbled,He couldn’t hardly stand.He had this frightenedLook in his eyes,Like he just fought a bear,He was ready to die.Well, I peeked through the key crack,Comin’ down the hallWas a long-legged manWho couldn’t hardly crawl.He muttered and he utteredIn broken French,And he looked like he’d been throughA monkey wrench.Well, by this timeI was a-scared to knock,I was a-scared to move,I’s in a state of shock.I hummed a little tuneAnd I shuffled my feetAnd I started walkin’ backwardsDown that broad street.Well, I got to the corner,I tried my best to smile.I turned around the cornerAnd I ran a bloody mile.Man, I wasn’t runnin’‘Cause I was sick,I was just a-runnin’To get out of there quick.Well, I tripped right alongAnd I’m a-wheezin’ in my chest.I musta run a mileIn a minute or less.I walked on a logAnd I tripped on a stump,I caught a fast freightWith a one-arm jump.So, if you’re travelin’ downLouisiana way,And you feel kinda lonesomeAnd you need a place to stay,Man, you’re better offIn your miseryThan to tackle that ladyAt one-oh-three. Boots of Spanish LeatherOh, I’m sailin’ away my own true love,I’m sailin’ away in the morning.Is there something I can send you from across the sea,From the place that I’ll be landing?No, there’s nothin’ you can send me, my own true love,There’s nothin’ I wish to be ownin’.Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled,From across that lonesome ocean.Oh, but I just thought you might want something fineMade of silver or of golden,Either from the mountains of MadridOr from the coast of Barcelona.Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest nightAnd the diamonds from the deepest ocean,I’d forsake them all for your sweet kiss,For that’s all I’m wishin’ to be ownin’.That I might be gone a long timeAnd it’s only that I’m askin’,Is there something I can send you to remember me by,To make your time more easy passin’.Oh, how can, how can you ask me again,It only brings me sorrow.The same thing I want from you today,I would want again tomorrow.I got a letter on a lonesome day,It was from her ship a-sailin’,Saying I don’t know when I’ll be comin’ back again,It depends on how I’m a-feelin’.Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way,I’m sure your mind is roamin’.I’m sure your heart is not with me,But with the country to where you’re goin’.So take heed, take heed of the western wind,Take heed of the stormy weather.And yes, there’s something you can send back to me,Spanish boots of Spanish leather. Born in TimeIn the lonely nightIn the blinking stardust of a pale blue lightYou’re comin’ thru to me in black and whiteWhen we were made of dreams.You’re blowing down the shaky street,You’re hearing my heart beatIn the record breaking heatWhere we were born in time.Bridge #1:Not one more night, not one more kiss,Not this time baby, no more of this,Takes too much skill, takes too much will,It’s revealing.You came, you saw, just like the lawYou married young, just like your ma,You tried and tried, you made me slideYou left me reelin’ with this feelin’.On the rising curveWhere the ways of nature will test every nerve,You won’t get anything you don’t deserveWhere we were born in time.Bridge #2:You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,You hang the flame, you’ll pay the price,Oh babe, that fireIs still smokin’.You were snow, you were rainYou were striped, you were plain,Oh babe, truer wordsHave not been spoken or broken.In the hills of mystery,In the foggy web of destiny,You can have what’s left of me,Where we were born in time.

Brownsville Girl, by Bob Dylan and Sam ShepardWell, there was this movie I seen one time,About a man riding ‘cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulpas the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath.Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square,I want him to feel what it’s like to every moment face his death.Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling inAnd you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain.You know I can’t believe we’ve lived so long and are still so far apart.The memory of you keeps callin’ after me like a rollin’ train.I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desertIn your busted down Ford and your platform heelsI could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meetAh, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.Well, we drove that car all night into San Anton’And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft.Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.I would have gone on after you but I didn’t feel like letting my head get blown off.Well, we’re drivin’ this car and the sun is comin’ up over the Rockies,Now I know she ain’t you but she’s here and she’s got that dark rhythm in her soul.But I’m too over the edge and I ain’t in the mood anymore to remember the times when I was your only manAnd she don’t want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control.Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon aboveBrownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love.Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards AmarilloWe pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a wreckin’ lot outside of town about a mile.Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back. She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.She said, “Henry ain’t here but you can come on in, he’ll be back in a little while.”Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin’ of bummin’ a ride back to where she started.But ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up.She said, “Welcome to the land of the living dead.” You could tell she was so broken-hearted.She said, “Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt.”“How far are y’all going?” Ruby asked us with a sigh.“We’re going all the way ‘til the wheels fall off and burn,‘Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies.”Ruby just smiled and said, “Ah, you know some babies never learn.”Something about that movie though, well I just can’t get it out of my headBut I can’t remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people movedAnd a lot of them seemed to be lookin’ my way.Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon aboveBrownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love.Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour.I was crossin’ the street when shots rang out.I didn’t know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.“We got him cornered in the churchyard,” I heard somebody shout.Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it, it said, “A man with no alibi.”You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,It was the best acting I saw anybody do.Now I’ve always been the kind of person that doesn’t like to trespass but sometimes you just find yourself over the line.Oh if there’s an original thought out there, I could use it right now.You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain’t sayin’ much. I could feel a whole lot better,If you were just here by my side to show me how.Well, I’m standin’ in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,Yeah, but you know it’s not the one that I had in mind.He’s got a new one out now, I don’t even know what it’s aboutBut I’ll see him in anything so I’ll stand in line.Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon aboveBrownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love.You know, it’s funny how things never turn out the way you had ‘em planned.The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name wasn’t Henry Porter.And you know there was somethin’ about you baby that I liked that was always too good for this worldJust like you always said there was something about me you liked that I left behind in the French Quarter.Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content.I don’t have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I’m gone.You always said people don’t do what they believe in, they just do what’s most convenient, then they repent.And I always said, “Hang on to me, baby, and let’s hope that the roof stays on.”There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice.I don’t remember who I was or where I was bound.All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun and he was shot in the back.Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon aboveBrownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love. Buckets of RainBuckets of rainBuckets of tearsGot all them buckets comin’ out of my ears.Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,I got all the love, honey baby,You can stand.I been meekAnd hard like an oakI seen pretty people disappear like smoke.Friends will arrive, friends will disappear,If you want me, honey baby,I’ll be here.Like your smileAnd your fingertipsLike the way that you move your lips.I like the cool way you look at me,Everything about you is bringing meMisery.Little red wagonLittle red bikeI ain’t no monkey but I know what I like.I like the way you love me strong and slow,I’m takin’ you with me, honey baby,When I go.Life is sadLife is a bustAll ya can do is do what you must.You do what you must do and ya do it well,I’ll do it for you, honey baby,Can’t you tell?

Canadee-i-o, by Bob Dylan (arr) Well, it’s all of fair and handsome girl,She’s all in her tender years.She fell in love with a sailor boy,It’s true she loved him well.For to go off to sea with himLike she did not know how,She longed to see that seaport townOf Canadee-i-o. So she bargained with the sailor boy,All for a piece of gold.Straightaway then he led herDown into the hold,Sayin’, “I’ll dress you up in sailor’s clothes,Your jacket shall be blue.You’ll see that seaport townOf Canadee-i-o. Now, when the other sailors heard the news,Well, they fell into a rage,And with all the ship’s companyThey were willing to engage.Saying, “We’ll tie her hands and feet, my boys,Overboard we’ll throw her.She’ll never see that seaport townCalled Canadee-i-o. Now, when the captain he heard the news,Well, he too fell in a rage,And with the whole ship’s companyHe was willing to engage,Sayin’, “She’ll stay in sailor’s clothes,Her color shall be blue,She’ll see that seaport townCall Canadee-i-o. Now, when they come down to CanadaScarcely ‘bout half a year,She’s married this bold captainWho called her his dear.She’s dressed in silks and satins now,She cuts a gallant show,Finest of the ladiesDown Canadee-i-o. Come, all you fair and tender girls,Wheresoever you may be,I’d have you to follow your own true loveWhene’er he goes to sea.For if the sailors prove false to you,Well, the captain, he might prove true.You’ll see the honor I have gainedBy the wearing of the blue. Caribbean WindShe was the rose of Sharon from paradise lostFrom the city of seven hills near the place of the cross.I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.Told about Jesus, told about the rain,She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slainBy a man who danced on the roof of the embassy.Was she a child or a woman, I can’t say whichFrom one to another she could to easily switchWe went into the wall to where the long arm of the law could not reach.Could I been used and played as a pawn?It certainly was possible as the gay night wore onWhere men bathed in perfume and celebrated free speech.And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to MexicoFanning the flames in the furnace of desireAnd them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,Bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire.She looked into my soul through the clothes that I woreShe said, “We got a mutual friend over by the door,And you know he’s got our best interest in mind.”He was well connected but her heart was a snareAnd she had left him to die in there,There were payments due and he was a little behind.The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,Ceiling fan broken, there’s a heat in my bed,Street band playing “Nearer My God to Thee.”We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring,She said, “I know what you’re thinking, but there ain’t a thingYou can do about it, so let us just agree to agree.”And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to MexicoFanning the flames in the furnace of desireAnd them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,Bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire.Atlantic City by the cold grey seaI hear a voice crying, “Daddy,” I always think it’s for me,But it’s only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.Every new messenger brings evil report‘Bout armies on the march and time that is shortAnd famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls.Would I have married her? I don’t know, I suppose.She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toesBut I kept hearing my name and I had to be movin’ on.I saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin,I saw a house in the country being torn from within.I heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to MexicoFanning the flames in the furnace of desireAnd them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,Bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire. Catfish, by Bob Dylan and Jacques LevyLazy stadium nightCatfish on the mound.“Strike three,” the umpire said,Batter have to go back and sit down.Catfish, million-dollar-man,Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.Used to work on Mr. Finley’s farmBut the old man wouldn’t paySo he packed his glove and took his armAn’ one day he just ran away.Catfish, million-dollar-man,Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.Come up where the Yankees are,Dress up in a pinstripe suit,Smoke a custom-made cigar,Wear an alligator boot.Catfish, million-dollar-man,Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.Carolina born and bred,Love to hunt the little quail.Got a hundred-acre spread,Got some huntin’ dogs for sale.Catfish, million-dollar-man,Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.Reggie Jackson at the plateSeein’ nothin’ but the curve,Swing too early or too lateGot to eat what Catfish serve.Catfish, million-dollar-man,Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.Even Billy Martin grinsWhen the Fish is in the game.Every season twenty winsGonna make the Hall of Fame.Catfish, million-dollar-man,Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can. Cat’s in the WellThe cat’s in the well, the wolf is looking down.The cat’s in the well, the wolf is looking down.He got his big bushy tail dragging all over the ground.The cat’s in the well, the gentle lady is asleep.Cat’s in the well, the gentle lady is asleep.She ain’t hearing a thing, the silence is a-stickin’ her deep.Bridge #1:The cat’s in the well and grief is showing its faceThe world’s being slaughtered and it’s such a bloody disgrace.The cat’s in the well, the horse is going bumpety bump.The cat’s in the well, and the horse is going bumpety bump.Back alley Sally is doing the American jump.Bridge #2:The cat’s in the well, and pappa is reading the news.His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.The cat’s in the well and the barn is full of bullThe cat’s in the well and the barn is full of bullThe night is so long and the table is oh, so fullBridge #3:The cat’s in the well and the servant is at the door.The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.The cat’s in the well, the leaves are starting to fallThe cat’s in the well, leaves are starting to fallGoodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all. Chimes of FreedomFar between sundown’s finish an’ midnight’s broken tollWe ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashingAs majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the soundsSeeming to be the chimes of freedom flashingFlashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fightFlashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flightAn’ for each an’ ev’ry underdog soldier in the nightAn’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.In the city’s melted furnace, unexpectedly we watchedWith faces hidden while the walls were tighteningAs the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin’ rainDissolved into the bells of the lightningTolling for the rebel, tolling for the rakeTolling for the luckless, the abandoned an’ forsakedTolling for the outcast, burnin’ constantly at stakeAn’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hailThe sky cracked its poems in naked wonderThat the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breezeLeaving only bells of lightning and its thunderStriking for the gentle, striking for the kindStriking for the guardians and protectors of the mindAn’ the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful timeAn’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.Through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled talesFor the disrobed faceless forms of no positionTolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughtsAll down in taken-for-granted situationsTolling for the deaf an’ blind, tolling for the muteTolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostituteFor the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an’ cheated by pursuitAn’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.Even though a cloud’s white curtain in a far-off corner flashedAn’ the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly liftingElectric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the onesCondemned to drift or else be kept from driftingTolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trailFor the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a taleAn’ for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jailAn’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.Starry-eyed an’ laughing as I recall when we were caughtTrapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspendedAs we listened one last time an’ we watched with one last lookSpellbound an’ swallowed ‘til the tolling endedTolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursedFor the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an’ worseAn’ for every hung-up person in the whole wide universeAn’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing. Changing of the GuardsSixteen years,Sixteen banners united over the fieldWhere the good shepherd grieves.Desperate men, desperate women divided,Spreading their wings ‘neath the falling leaves.Fortune calls.I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace,Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down.She’s smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born,On midsummer’s eve, near the tower.The cold-blooded moon.The captain waits above the celebrationSending his thoughts to a beloved maidWhose ebony face is beyond communication.The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.They shaved her head.She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo.A messenger arrived with a black nightingale.I seen her on the stairs and I couldn’t help but follow,Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.I stumbled to my feet.I rode past destruction in the ditchesWith the stitches still mending ‘neath a heart-shaped tattoo.Renegade priests and treacherous young witchesWere handing out the flowers that I’d given to you.The palace of mirrorsWhere dog soldiers are reflected,The endless road and the wailing of chimes,The empty rooms where her memory is protected,Where the angels’ voices whisper to the souls of previous times.She wakes him upForty-eight hours later, the sun is breakingNear broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks.She’s begging to know what measures he now will be taking.He’s pulling her down and she’s clutching on to his long golden locks.Gentlemen, he said,I don’t need your organization, I’ve shined your shoes,I’ve moved your mountains and marked your cardsBut Eden is burning, either brace yourself for eliminationOr else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.Peace will comeWith tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fireBut will bring us no reward when her false idols fallAnd cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreatingBetween the King and the Queen of Swords.

And he carries all his moneyIn a diamond-studded jar.He never took much troubleWith the process of the law. I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys,Did offer him my hand,He gave a string of horsesSo old they could not stand. And I nearly starved to death, boys,He did mistreat me so,And I never saved a dollarIn the pay of Diamond Joe. Now his bread it was corn dodgerAnd his meat you couldn’t chaw,Nearly drove me crazyWith the waggin’ of his jaw. And the tellin’ of his story,Mean to let you knowThat there never was a rounderThat could lie like Diamond Joe.Instrumental Now, I tried three times to quit him,But he did argue soI’m still punchin’ cattleIn the pay of Diamond Joe. And when I’m called up yonderAnd it’s my time to go,Give my blankets to my buddiesGive the fleas to Diamond Joe DirgeI hate myself for lovin’ you and the weakness that it showedYou were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,I hate myself for lovin’ you and I’m glad the curtain fell.I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressedAnd the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin. Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped,Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped.Like a slave in orbit, he’s beaten ‘til he’s tame,All for a moment’s glory and it’s a dirty, rotten shame. There are those who worship loneliness, I’m not one of them,In this age of fiberglass I’m searching for a gem.The crystal ball up on the wall hasn’t shown me nothing yet,I’ve paid the price of solitude, but at last I’m out of debt.Can’t recall a useful thing you ever did for me‘Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees.We stared into each other’s eyes ‘til one of us would break,No use to apologize, what diff’rence would it make?So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine,The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I’m at,I hate myself for lovin’ you, but I should get over that.

Drifter’s Escape“Oh, help me in my weakness,”I heard the drifter say,As they carried him from the courtroomAnd were taking him away.“My trip hasn’t been a pleasant oneAnd my time it isn’t long,And I still do not knowWhat it was that I’ve done wrong.”Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside,A tear came to his eye,“You fail to understand,” he said,“Why must you even try?”Outside, the crowd was stirring,You could hear it from the door.Inside, the judge was stepping down,While the jury cried for more.“Oh, stop that cursed jury,”Cried the attendant and the nurse,“The trial was bad enough,But this is ten times worse.”Just then a bolt of lightningStruck the courthouse out of shape,And while ev’rybody knelt to prayThe drifter did escape.

Dusty Old FairgroundsWell, it’s all up from Florida at the start of the spring,The trucks and the trailers will be windingLike a bullet we’ll shoot for the carnival route.We’re following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.From the Michigan mud past the Wisconsin sun‘Cross that Minnesota border, keep ‘em scramblingThrough the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands,We’re following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.Hit Fargo on the jump and down to Aberdeen‘Cross them old Black Hills, keep ‘em rollingThrough the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana.We’re following them fairgrounds a-calling.As the white line on the highway sails under your wheels,I’ve gazed from the trailer window laughing.Oh, our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright.Following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.It’s a-many a friend that follows the bend,The jugglers, the hustlers, the gamblers.Well, I’ve spent my time with the fortune-telling kindFollowing them fairgrounds a-calling.Oh, it’s pound down the rails and it’s tie down the tents,Get that canvas flag a-flying.Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the ferris wheel windFollowing them fairgrounds a-calling.Well, it’s roll into town straight to the fairgroundsJust behind the posters that are hangingAnd it’s fill up every space with a different kind of faceFollowing them fairgrounds a-calling.Get the dancing girls in front, get the gambling show behind,Hear that old music box a-banging.Hear them kids, faces, smiles, up and down the midway aislesWe’re following them fairgrounds a-calling.It’s a-drag it on down by the deadline in the town,Hit the old highway by the morningAnd it’s ride yourself blind for the next town on timeFollowing them fairgrounds a-calling.As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttimeDrinking red wine as we’re rolling,Many a turnin’ I turn, many a lesson I learnFrom following them fairgrounds a-calling.And it’s roll back down to St. PetersburgTie down the trailers and camp ‘emAnd the money that we made will pay for the spaceFrom following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling. Emotionally YoursCome baby, find me, come baby, remind me of where I once begun.Come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you’re the one.I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors.But I will always be emotionally yours.Come baby, rock me, come baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart.Come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start.I could be dreaming but I keep believing you’re the one I’m livin’ for.And I will always be emotionally yours.It’s like my whole life never happened,When I see you, it’s as if I never had a thought.I know this dream, it might be crazy,But it’s the only one I’ve got.Come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, I would be satisfied.Come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide.I could be unraveling wherever I’m traveling, even to foreign shores.But I will always be emotionally yours. Every Grain of SandIn the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest needWhen the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seedThere’s a dyin’ voice within me reaching out somewhere,Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.Don’t have the inclination to look back on any mistake,Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break.In the fury of the moment I can see the Master’s handIn every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer.The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the wayTo ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.I gaze into the doorway of temptation’s angry flameAnd every time I pass that way I always hear my name.Then onward in my journey I come to understandThat every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the nightIn the violence of a summer’s dream, in the chill of a wintry light,In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the seaSometimes I turn, there’s someone there, other times it’s only me.I am hanging in the balance of the reality of manLike every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand. Eternal CircleI sang the song slowlyAs she stood in the shadowsShe stepped to the lightAs my silver strings spunShe called with her eyesTo the tune I’s a-playin’But the song it was longAnd I’d only begunThrough a bullet of lightHer face was reflectin’The fast fading wordsThat rolled from my tongueWith a long-distance lookHer eyes was on fireBut the song it was longAnd there was more to be sung.My eyes danced a circleAcross her clear outlineWith her head tilted sidewaysShe called me againAs the tune drifted outShe breathed hard through the echoBut the song it was longAnd it was far to the endI glanced at my guitarAnd played it pretendin’That of all the eyes out thereI could see noneAs her thoughts pounded hardLike the pierce of an arrowBut the song it was longAnd it had to get doneAs the tune finally foldedI laid down the guitarThen looked for the girlWho’d stayed for so longBut her shadow was missin’For all of my searchin’So I picked up my guitarAnd began the next song Everything is BrokenBroken lines, broken strings,Broken threads, broken springs,Broken idols, broken heads,People sleeping in broken beds.Ain’t no use jivingAin’t no use jokingEverything is broken.Broken bottles, broken plates,Broken switches, broken gates,Broken dishes, broken parts,Streets are filled with broken hearts.Broken words never meant to be spoken,Everything is broken.Bridge: Seem like every time you stop and turn aroundSomething else just hit the groundBroken cutters, broken saws,Broken buckles, broken laws,Broken bodies, broken bones,Broken voices on broken phones.Take a deep breath, feel like you’re chokin’,Everything is broken.Bridge: Every time you leave and go off someplaceThings fall to pieces in my faceBroken hands on broken ploughs,Broken treaties, broken vows,Broken pipes, broken tools,People bending broken rules.Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,Everything is broken. FarewellOh it’s fare thee well my darlin’ true,I’m leavin’ in the first hour of the morn.I’m bound off for the bay of MexicoOr maybe the coast of Californ.So it’s fare thee well my own true love,We’ll meet another day, another time.It ain’t the leavin’That’s a-grievin’ meBut my true love who’s bound to stay behind.Oh the weather is against me and the wind blows hardAnd the rain she’s a-turnin’ into hail.I still might strike it lucky on a highway goin’ west,Though I’m travelin’ on a path beaten trail.So it’s fare thee well my own true love,We’ll meet another day, another time.It ain’t the leavin’That’s a-grievin’ meBut my true love who’s bound to stay behind.I will write you a letter from time to time,As I’m ramblin’ you can travel with me too.With my head, my heart and my hands, my love,I will send what I learn back home to you.So it’s fare thee well my own true love,We’ll meet another day, another time.It ain’t the leavin’That’s a-grievin’ meBut my true love who’s bound to stay behind.I will tell you of the laughter and of troubles,Be them somebody else’s or my own.With my hands in my pockets and my coat collar high,I will travel unnoticed and unknown.So it’s fare thee well my own true love,We’ll meet another day, another time.It ain’t the leavin’That’s a-grievin’ meBut my true love who’s bound to stay behind.I’ve heard tell of a town where I might as well be bound,It’s down around the old Mexican plains.They say that the people are all friendly thereAnd all they ask of you is your name.So it’s fare thee well my own true love,We’ll meet another day, another time.It ain’t the leavin’That’s a-grievin’ meBut my true love who’s bound to stay behind.

House Carpenter, by Bob Dylan (arr)Well met, well met, my own true loveWell met, well met, cried sheI’ve just returned from the salt, salt seaAnd it’s all for the love of theeI could have married a King’s daughter thereShe would have married meBut I have forsaken my King’s daughter thereIt’s all for the love of theeWell, if you could have married a King’s daughter thereI’m sure you’re the one to blameFor I am married to a house carpenterAnd I’m sure he’s a fine young manForsake, forsake your house carpenterAnd come away with meI’ll take you where the green grass growsOn the shores of sunny ItalySo up she picked her babies threeAnd gave them kisses, one, two, threeSaying “take good care of your daddy while I’m goneAnd keep him good company.”Well, they were sailin’ about two weeksI’m sure it was not threeWhen the younger of the girls, she came on deckSayin’ she wants company“Well, are you weepin’ for your house and home?Or are you weepin’ for your babies three?”“Well, I’m not weepin’ for my house carpenterI’m weepin’ for my babies three.”Oh what are those hills yonder, my loveThey look as white as snowThose are the hill of heaven, my loveYou and I’ll never knowOh what are those hills yonder, my loveThey look as dark as nightThose are the hills of hell-fire my loveWhere you and I will uniteOh twice around went the gallant shipI’m sure it was not threeWhen the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leakAnd it drifted to the bottom of the sea Hurricane, by Bob Dylan and Jacques LevyPistol shots ring out in the barroom nightEnter Patty Valentine from the upper hall.She sees the bartender in a pool of blood,Cries out, “My God, they killed them all!”Here comes the story of the Hurricane,The man the authorities came to blameFor somethin’ that he never done.Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a beenThe champion of the world.Three bodies lyin’ there does Patty seeAnd another man named Bello, movin’ around mysteriously.“I didn’t do it,” he says, and he throws up his hands“I was only robbin’ the register, I hope you understand.I saw them leavin’,” he says, and he stops“One of us had better call up the cops.”And so Patty calls the copsAnd they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin’In the hot New Jersey night.Meanwhile, far away in another part of townRubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin’ around.Number one contender for the middleweight crownHad no idea what kinda shit was about to go downWhen a cop pulled him over to the side of the roadJust like the time before and the time before that.In Paterson that’s just the way things go.If you’re black you might as well not show up on the street‘Less you wanna draw the heat.Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops.Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin’ aroundHe said, “I saw two men runnin’ out, they looked like middleweightsThey jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates.”And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head.Cop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”So they took him to the infirmaryAnd though this man could hardly seeThey told him that he could identify the guilty men.Four in the mornin’ and they haul Rubin in,Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs.The wounded man looks up through his one dyin’ eyeSays, “Wha’d you bring him in here for? He ain’t the guy!”Yes, here’s the story of the Hurricane,The man the authorities came to blameFor somethin’ that he never done.Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a beenThe champion of the world.Four months later, the ghettos are in flame,Rubin’s in South America, fightin’ for his nameWhile Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery gameAnd the cops are puttin’ the screws to him, lookin’ for somebody to blame.“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin’ that night?”“Don’t forget that you are white.”Arthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure.”Cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a breakWe got you for the motel job and we’re talkin’ to your friend BelloNow you don’t wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.You’ll be doin’ society a favor.That sonofabitch is brave and gettin’ braver.We want to put his ass in stirWe want to pin this triple murder on himHe ain’t no Gentleman Jim.”Rubin could take a man out with just one punchBut he never did like to talk about it all that much.It’s my work, he’d say, and I do it for payAnd when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my wayUp to some paradiseWhere the trout streams flow and the air is niceAnd ride a horse along a trail.But then they took him to the jailhouseWhere they try to turn a man into a mouse.All of Rubin’s cards were marked in advanceThe trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance.The judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slumsTo the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bumAnd to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger.No one doubted that he pulled the trigger.And though they could not produce the gun,The D.A. said he was the one who did the deedAnd the all-white jury agreed.Rubin Carter was falsely tried.The crime was murder “one,” guess who testified?Bello and Bradley and they both baldly liedAnd the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.How can the life of such a manBe in the palm of some fool’s hand?To see him obviously framedCouldn’t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a landWhere justice is a game.Now all the criminals in their coats and their tiesAre free to drink martinis and watch the sun riseWhile Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cellAn innocent man in a living hell.That’s the story of the Hurricane,But it won’t be over till they clear his nameAnd give him back the time he’s done.Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a beenThe champion of the world. I Am a Lonesome HoboI am a lonesome hoboWithout family or friends,Where another man’s life might begin,That’s exactly where mine ends.I have tried my hand at bribery,Blackmail and deceit,And I’ve served time for ev’rything‘Cept beggin’ on the street.Well, once I was rather prosperous,There was nothing I did lack.I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouthAnd silk upon my back.But I did not trust my brother,I carried him to blame,Which led me to my fatal doom,To wander off in shame.Kind ladies and kind gentlemen,Soon I will be gone,But let me just warn you all,Before I do pass on;Stay free from petty jealousies,Live by no man’s code,And hold your judgment for yourselfLest you wind up on this road. I and IBeen so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wedTo some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.I and IIn creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives.I and IOne says to the other, no man sees my face and lives.Think I’ll go out and go for a walk,Not much happenin’ here, nothin’ ever does.Besides, if she wakes up now, she’ll just want me to talkI got nothin’ to say, ‘specially about whatever was.I and IIn creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives.I and IOne says to the other, no man sees my face and lives.Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don’t win the race,It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice’s beautiful faceAnd to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.I and IIn creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives.I and IOne says to the other, no man sees my face and lives.Outside of two men on a train platform there’s nobody in sight,They’re waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.The world could come to an end tonight, but that’s all right.She should still be there sleepin’ when I get back.I and IIn creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives.I and IOne says to the other, no man sees my face and lives.Noontime, and I’m still pushin’ myself along the road, the darkest part,Into the narrow lanes, I can’t stumble or stay put.Someone else is speakin’ with my mouth, but I’m listening only to my heart.I’ve made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot.I and IIn creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives.I and IOne says to the other, no man sees my face and lives. I Believe in YouThey ask me how I feelAnd if my love is realAnd how I know I’ll make it through.And they, they look at me and frown,They’d like to drive me from this town,They don’t want me around‘Cause I believe in you.They show me to the door,They say don’t come back no more‘Cause I don’t be like they’d like me to,And I walk out on my ownA thousand miles from homeBut I don’t feel alone‘Cause I believe in you.I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,I believe in you even though we be apart.I believe in you even on the morning after.Oh, when the dawn is nearingOh, when the night is disappearingOh, this feeling is still here in my heart.Don’t let me drift too far,Keep me where you areWhere I will always be renewed.And that which you’ve given me todayIs worth more than I could payAnd no matter what they sayI believe in you.I believe in you when winter turn to summer,I believe in you when white turn to black,I believe in you even though I be outnumbered.Oh, though the earth may shake meOh, though my friends forsake meOh, even that couldn’t make me go back.Don’t let me change my heart,Keep me set apartFrom all the plans they do pursue.And I, I don’t mind the painDon’t mind the driving rainI know I will sustain‘Cause I believe in you. I Don’t Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)I can’t understand,She let go of my handAn’ left me here facing the wall.I’d sure like t’ knowWhy she did go,But I can’t get close t’ her at all.Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime,She said she would never forget.But now mornin’s clear,It’s like I ain’t here,She just acts like we never have met.It’s all new t’ me,Like some mystery,It could even be like a myth.Yet it’s hard t’ think on,That she’s the same oneThat last night I was with.From darkness, dreams’re deserted,Am I still dreamin’ yet?I wish she’d unlockHer voice once an’ talk,‘Stead of acting like we never have met.If she ain’t feelin’ well,Then why don’t she tell‘Stead of turnin’ her back t’ my face?Without any doubt,She seems too far outFor me t’ return t’ her chase.Though the night ran swirling an’ whirling,I remember her whispering yet.But evidently she don’tAn’ evidently she won’t,She just acts like we never have met.If I didn’t have t’ guess,I’d gladly confessT’ anything I might’ve tried.If I was with ‘er too longOr have done something wrong,I wish she’d tell me what it is, I’ll run an’ hide.Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played,Her mouth was watery and wet.But now something has changedFor she ain’t the same,She just acts like we never have met.I’m leavin’ today,I’ll be on my wayOf this I can’t say very much.But if you want me to,I can be just like youAn’ pretend that we never have touched.An’ if anybody asks me, “Is it easy to forget?”I’ll say, “It’s easily done,You just pick anyone,An’ pretend that you never have met!” I Pity the Poor ImmigranI pity the poor immigrantWho wishes he would’ve stayed home,Who uses all his power to do evilBut in the end is always left so alone.That man whom with his fingers cheatsAnd who lies with ev’ry breath,Who passionately hates his lifeAnd likewise, fears his death.I pity the poor immigrantWhose strength is spent in vain,Whose heaven is like Ironsides,Whose tears are like rain,Who eats but is not satisfied,Who hears but does not see,Who falls in love with wealth itselfAnd turns his back on me.I pity the poor immigrantWho tramples through the mud,Who fills his mouth with laughingAnd who builds his town with blood,Whose visions in the final endMust shatter like the glass.I pity the poor immigrantWhen his gladness comes to pass. I Shall Be FreeWell, I took me a woman late last night,I’s three-fourths drunk, she looked uptight.She took off her wheel, took off her bell,Took off her wig, said, “How do I smell?”I hot-footed it . . . bare-naked . . .Out the window!Well, sometimes I might get drunk,Walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk.Don’t hurt me none, don’t hurt my pride‘Cause I got my little lady right by my side.(Right thereProud as can be)I’s out there paintin’ on the old woodshedWhen a can a black paint it fell on my head.I went down to scrub and rubBut I had to sit in back of the tub.(Cost a quarterAnd I had to get out quick . . .Someone wanted to come in and take a sauna)Well, my telephone rang it would not stop,It’s President Kennedy callin’ me up.He said, “My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?”I said, “My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,Anita Ekberg,Sophia Loren.”(Put ‘em all in the same room with Ernest Borgnine!)Well, I got a woman sleeps on a cot,She yells and hollers and squeals a lot.Licks my face and tickles my ear,Bends me over and buys me beer.(She’s a honeymoonerA June croonerA spoon feederAnd a natural leader)Oh, there ain’t no use in me workin’ so heavy,I got a woman who works on the levee.Pumping that water up to her neck,Every week she sends me a monthly check.(She’s a humdingerFolk singerDead ringerFor a thing-a-muh jigger)Late one day in the middle of the week,Eyes were closed I was half asleep.I chased me a woman up the hill,Right in the middle of an air raid drill.It was Little Bo Peep!(I jumped a fallout shelterI jumped a bean stalkI jumped a ferris wheel)Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote,He’s a-runnin’ for office on the ballot note.He’s out there preachin’ in front of the steeple,Tellin’ me he loves all kinds-a people.(He’s eatin’ bagelsHe’s eatin’ pizzaHe’s eatin’ chitlinsHe’s eatin’ bullshit!)Oh, set me down on a television floor,I’ll flip the channel to number four.Out of the shower comes a grown-up manWith a bottle of hair oil in his hand.(It’s that greasy kid stuff.What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, isWhat do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner,Charles de GaulleAnd Robert Louis Stevenson?)Well, the funniest woman I ever seenWas the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.She takes about fifteen baths a day,Wants me to grow a cigar on my face.(She’s a little bit heavy!)Well, ask me why I’m drunk alla time,It levels my head and eases my mind.I just walk along and stroll and sing,I see better days and I do better things.(I catch dinosaursI make love to Elizabeth Taylor . . .Catch hell from Richard Burton!) I Dreamed I Saw St. AugustineI dreamed I saw St. Augustine,Alive as you or me,Tearing through these quartersIn the utmost misery,With a blanket underneath his armAnd a coat of solid gold,Searching for the very soulsWhom already have been sold.“Arise, arise,” he cried so loud,In a voice without restraint,“Come out, ye gifted kings and queensAnd hear my sad complaint.No martyr is among ye nowWhom you can call your own,So go on your way accordinglyBut know you’re not alone.”I dreamed I saw St. Augustine,Alive with fiery breath,And I dreamed I was amongst the onesThat put him out to death.Oh, I awoke in anger,So alone and terrified,I put my fingers against the glassAnd bowed my head and cried. I Shall Be Free No.10I’m just average, common tooI’m just like him, the same as youI’m everybody’s brother and sonI ain’t different from anyoneIt ain’t no use a-talking to meIt’s just the same as talking to you.I was shadow-boxing earlier in the dayI figured I was ready for Cassius ClayI said “Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come26, 27, 28, 29, I’m gonna make your face look just like mineFive, four, three, two, one, Cassius Clay you’d better run99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won’t even recognize you14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen.”Well, I don’t know, but I’ve been toldThe streets in heaven are lined with goldI ask you how things could get much worseIf the Russians happen to get up there first.Wowee! Pretty scary!Now, I’m liberal, but to a degreeI want ev’rybody to be freeBut if you think that I’ll let Barry GoldwaterMove in next door and marry my daughterYou must think I’m crazy!I wouldn’t let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.Well, I set my monkey on the logAnd ordered him to do the DogHe wagged his tail and shook his headAnd he went and did the Cat insteadHe’s a weird monkey, very funky.I sat with my high-heeled sneakers onWaiting to play tennis in the noonday sunI had my white shorts rolled up past my waistAnd my wig-hat was falling in my faceBut they wouldn’t let me on the tennis court.I gotta woman, she’s so meanShe sticks my boots in the washing machineSticks me with buckshot when I’m nudePuts bubblegum in my foodShe’s funny, wants my money, calls me “honey.”Now I gotta friend who spends his lifeStabbing my picture with a bowie-knifeDreams of strangling me with a scarfWhen my name comes up he pretends to barf.I’ve got a million friends!Now they asked me to read a poemAt the sorority sister’s homeI got knocked down and my head was swimmin’I wound up with the Dean of WomenYippee! I’m a poet, and I know it.Hope I don’t blow it.I’m gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strangeSo I look like a walking mountain rangeAnd I’m gonna ride into Omaha on a horseOut to the country club and the golf course.Carry the New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds.Now you’re probably wondering by nowJust what this song is all aboutWhat’s probably got you baffled moreIs what this thing here is for.It’s nothingIt’s something I learned over in England. I Shall Be ReleasedThey say ev’rything can be replaced,Yet ev’ry distance is not near.So I remember ev’ry faceOf ev’ry man who put me here.I see my light come shiningFrom the west unto the east.Any day now, any day now,I shall be released.They say ev’ry man needs protection,They say ev’ry man must fall.Yet I swear I see my reflectionSome place so high above this wall.I see my light come shiningFrom the west unto the east.Any day now, any day now,I shall be released.Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,Is a man who swears he’s not to blame.All day long I hear him shout so loud,Crying out that he was framed.I see my light come shiningFrom the west unto the east.Any day now, any day now,I shall be released. I Threw It All AwayI once held her in my arms,She said she would always stay.But I was cruel,I treated her like a fool,I threw it all away.Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand,And rivers that ran through ev’ry day.I must have been mad,I never knew what I had,Until I threw it all away.Love is all there is, it makes the world go ‘round,Love and only love, it can’t be denied.No matter what you think about itYou just won’t be able to do without it.Take a tip from one who’s tried.So if you find someone that gives you all of her love,Take it to your heart, don’t let it stray,For one thing that’s certain,You will surely be a-hurtin’,If you throw it all away.

I’ll Remember YouI’ll remember youWhen I’ve forgotten all the rest,You to me were true,You to me were the best.When there is no more,You cut to the coreQuicker than anyone I knew.When I’m all aloneIn the great unknown,I’ll remember you.I’ll remember youAt the end of the trail,I had so much left to do,I had so little time to fail.There’s some people thatYou don’t forget,Even though you’ve only seen’mOne time or two.When the roses fadeAnd I’m in the shade,I’ll remember you.Didn’t I, didn’t I try to love you?Didn’t I, didn’t I try to care?Didn’t I sleep, didn’t I weep beside youWith the rain blowing in your hair?I’ll remember youWhen the wind blows through the piney wood.It was you who came right through,It was you who understood.Though I’d never sayThat I done it the wayThat you’d have liked me to.In the end,My dear sweet friend,I’ll remember you. Idiot WindSomeone’s got it in for me, they’re planting stories in the pressWhoever it is I wish they’d cut it out but when they will I can only guess.They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me.I can’t help it if I’m lucky.People see me all the time and they just can’t remember how to actTheir minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts.Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at,I couldn’t believe after all these years, you didn’t know me better than thatSweet lady.Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth,Blowing down the backroads headin’ south.Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,You’re an idiot, babe.It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe.I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strikeI haven’t known peace and quiet for so long I can’t remember what it’s like.There’s a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin’ out of a boxcar door,You didn’t know it, you didn’t think it could be done, in the final end he won the warsAfter losin’ every battle.I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin’ ‘bout the way things sometimes areVisions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin’ me see stars.You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies.One day you’ll be in the ditch, flies buzzin’ around your eyes,Blood on your saddle.Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb,Blowing through the curtains in your room.Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,You’re an idiot, babe.It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe.It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apartYou tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn’t enough to change my heart.Now everything’s a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped,What’s good is bad, what’s bad is good, you’ll find out when you reach the topYou’re on the bottom.I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blindI can’t remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyesdon’t look into mine.The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the buildingburned.I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the springtimeturned Slowly into autumn.Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull,From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol.Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,You’re an idiot, babe.It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe.I can’t feel you anymore, I can’t even touch the books you’ve readEvery time I crawl past your door, I been wishin’ I was somebody else instead.Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memoryAnd all your ragin’ glory.I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I’m finally free,I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.You’ll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above,And I’ll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love,And it makes me feel so sorry.Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats,Blowing through the letters that we wrote.Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves,We’re idiots, babe.It’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves. If I Don’t Be There By Morning, by Bob Dylan and Helena SpringsBlue sky upon the horizon,Private eye on my trail,And if I don’t be there by morningShe’ll know that I must’ve spent the night in jail.I been runnin’ from Memphis to L.A.,Had an appointment set sometime for todayAnd if I don’t be there by morningShe’ll know that I must have gone the other way.Finding my way home to you, girl, lonely and blue, mistreated too,Sometimes I think about you, girl, is it true that you think of me too?I got a woman living in L.A.,I got a woman waiting for my pay,And if I don’t be there by morningPack my clothes, get down on your knees and pray.I left my woman with a twenty-dollar bill,Left her waiting, hope she’s waiting for me still.But if I don’t be there by morningI guess that I never will.Finding my way home to you, girl, lonely and blue, mistreated too,Sometimes I think about you, girl, is it true that you think of me too?I left my woman with a twenty-dollar bill,Left her waiting, hope she’s waiting for me still.Well, if I don’t be there by morningI guess that I never will. If Dogs Run FreeIf dogs run free, then why not weAcross the swooping plain?My ears hear a symphonyOf two mules, trains and rain.The best is always yet to come,That’s what they explain to me.Just do your thing, you’ll be king,If dogs run free.If dogs run free, why not meAcross the swamp of time?My mind weaves a symphonyAnd tapestry of rhyme.Oh, winds which rush my tale to theeSo it may flow and be,To each his own, it’s all unknown,If dogs run free.If dogs run free, then what must be,Must be, and that is all.True love can make a blade of grassStand up straight and tall.In harmony with the cosmic sea,True love needs no company,It can cure the soul, it can make it whole,If dogs run free. If You Gotta Go, Go NowListen to me, baby,There’s something you must see.I want to be with you, gal,If you want to be with me.But if you got to go,It’s all right.But if you got to go, go now,Or else you gotta stay all night.It ain’t that I’m questionin’ you.To take part in any quiz.It’s just that I ain’t got no watchAn’ you keep askin’ me what time it is.But if you got to go,It’s all right.But if you got to go, go now,Or else you gotta stay all night.I am just a poor boy, baby,Lookin’ to connect.But I certainly don’t want you thinkin’That I ain’t got any respect.But if you got to go,It’s all right.But if you got to go, go now,Or else you gotta stay all night.You know I’d have nightmaresAnd a guilty conscience, too,If I kept you from anythingThat you really wanted to do.But if you got to go,It’s all right.But if you got to go, go now,Or else you gotta stay all night.It ain’t that I’m wantin’Anything you never gave before.It’s just that I’ll be sleepin’ soon,It’ll be too dark for you to find the door.But if you got to go,It’s all right.But if you got to go, go now,Or else you gotta stay all night. If Not for YouIf not for you,Babe, I couldn’t find the door,Couldn’t even see the floor,I’d be sad and blue,If not for you.If not for you,Babe, I’d lay awake all night,Wait for the mornin’ lightTo shine in through,But it would not be new,If not for you.If not for youMy sky would fall,Rain would gather too.Without your love I’d be nowhere at all,I’d be lost if not for you,And you know it’s true.If not for youMy sky would fall,Rain would gather too.Without your love I’d be nowhere at all,Oh! What would I doIf not for you.If not for you,Winter would have no spring,Couldn’t hear the robin sing,I just wouldn’t have a clue,Anyway it wouldn’t ring true,If not for you.

Isis, by Bob Dylan and Jacques LevyI married Isis on the fifth day of May,But I could not hold on to her very long.So I cut off my hair and I rode straight awayFor the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong.I came to a high place of darkness and light.The dividing line ran through the center of town.I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.A man in the corner approached me for a match.I knew right away he was not ordinary.He said, “Are you lookin’ for somethin’ easy to catch?”I said, “I got no money.” He said, “That ain’t necessary.”We set out that night for the cold in the North.I gave him my blanket, he gave me his word.I said, “Where are we goin’?” He said we’d be back by the fourth.I said, “That’s the best news that I’ve ever heard.”I was thinkin’ about turquoise, I was thinkin’ about gold,I was thinkin’ about diamonds and the world’s biggest necklace.As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,I was thinkin’ about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.How she told me that one day we would meet up again,And things would be different the next time we wed,If I only could hang on and just be her friend.I still can’t remember all the best things she said.We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice.He said, “There’s a body I’m tryin’ to find.If I carry it out it’ll bring a good price.”‘Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.The wind it was howlin’ and the snow was outrageous.We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.When he died I was hopin’ that it wasn’t contagious,But I made up my mind that I had to go on.I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.There was no jewels, no nothin’, I felt I’d been had.When I saw that my partner was just bein’ friendly,When I took up his offer I must-a been mad.I picked up his body and I dragged h m inside,Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied.Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise.Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed,I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes.I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead.She said, “Where ya been?” I said, “No place special.”She said, “You look different.” I said, “Well, not quite.”She said, “You been gone.” I said, “That’s only natural.”She said, “You gonna stay?” I said, “Yeah, I jes might.”Isis, oh, Isis, you mystical child.What drives me to you is what drives me insane.I still can remember the way that you smiledOn the fifth day of May in the drizzlin’ rain. It’s All Over Now, Baby BlueYou must leave now, take what you need, you think will last.But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast.Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,Crying like a fire in the sun.Look out the saints are comin’ throughAnd it’s all over now, Baby Blue.The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense.Take what you have gathered from coincidence.The empty-handed painter from your streetsIs drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.This sky, too, is folding under youAnd it’s all over now, Baby Blue.All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home.All your reindeer armies, are all going home.The lover who just walked out your doorHas taken all his blankets from the floor.The carpet, too, is moving under youAnd it’s all over now, Baby Blue.Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you.Forget the dead you’ve left, they will not follow you.The vagabond who’s rapping at your doorIs standing in the clothes that you once wore.Strike another match, go start anewAnd it’s all over now, Baby Blue. It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to CryWell, I ride on a mailtrain, baby,Can’t buy a thrill.Well, I’ve been up all night, baby,Leanin’ on the window sill.Well, if I dieOn top of the hillAnd if I don’t make it,You know my baby will.Don’t the moon look good, mama,Shinin’ through the trees?Don’t the brakeman look good, mama,Flagging down the “Double E”?Don’t the sun look goodGoin’ down over the sea?Don’t my gal look fineWhen she’s comin’ after me?Now the wintertime is coming,The windows are filled with frost.I went to tell everybody,But I could not get across.Well, I wanna be your lover, baby,I don’t wanna be your boss.Don’t say I never warned youWhen your train gets lost.

Joey, by Bob Dylan and Jacques LevyBorn in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows whenOpened up his eyes to the tune of an accordionAlways on the outside of whatever side there wasWhen they asked him why it had to be that way, “Well,” he answered, “just because.”Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last.They called Joe “Crazy,” the baby they called “Kid Blast.”Some say they lived off gambling and runnin’ numbers too.It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.Joey, Joey,King of the streets, child of clay.Joey, Joey,What made them want to come and blow you away?There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from thatNo one ever knew for sure where they were really at.When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof.He went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin’ he was bulletproof.The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streetsJoey and his brothers suffered terrible defeatsTill they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners.They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs.The hostages were tremblin’ when they heard a man exclaim,“Let’s blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame.”But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, “We’re not those kind of men.It’s peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again.”Joey, Joey,King of the streets, child of clay.Joey, Joey,What made them want to come and blow you away?The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. SmithThey got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with.“What time is it?” said the judge to Joey when they met“Five to ten,” said Joey. The judge says, “That’s exactly what you get.”He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm ReichThey threw him in the hole one time for tryin’ to stop a strike.His closest friends were black men ‘cause they seemed to understandWhat it’s like to be in society with a shackle on your hand. When they let him out in ‘71 he’d lost a little weightBut he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.He tried to find the way back into the life he left behindTo the boss he said, “I have returned and now I want what’s mine.”Joey, Joey,King of the streets, child of clay.Joey, Joey,Why did they have to come and blow you away?It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun“I’m around too many children,” he’d say, “they should never know of one.”Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe,Emptied out the register, said, “Tell ‘em it was Crazy Joe.”One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New YorkHe could see it comin’ through the door as he lifted up his fork.He pushed the table over to protect his familyThen he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.Joey, Joey,King of the streets, child of clay.Joey, Joey,What made them want to come and blow you away?Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep.I heard his best friend Frankie say, “He ain’t dead, he’s just asleep.”Then I saw the old man’s limousine head back towards the graveI guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mournedThey said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.And someday if God’s in heaven overlookin’ His preserveI know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.Joey, Joey,King of the streets, child of clay.Joey, Joey,What made them want to come and blow you away? Jim Jones, by Bob Dylan (arr)Come and listen for a moment, lads,And hear me tell my tale.How across the sea from EnglandI was condemned to sail.Now the jury found me guilty,Then says the judge, says he,“Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I’m sending youAcross the stormy sea.But take a tip before you shipTo join the iron gang.Don’t get too gay in Botany Bay,Or else you’ll surely hang.Or else you’ll surely hang,” says he.“And after that, Jim Jones,It’s high above on the gallows treeThe crows will pick your bones.” And our ship was high upon the seaThen pirates came along,But the soldiers on our convict shipWere full five hundred strong.For they opened fire and somehow droveThat pirate ship away.But I’d rather have joined that pirate shipTan gone to Botany Bay.With the storms ragin’ round us,And the winds a-blowin’ gale,I’d rather have drowned in miseryThan gone to New South Wales. Now it’s day and night and the irons clang,And like poor galley slavesWe toil and toil, and when we dieMust fill dishonored graves,And it’s by and by I’ll slip my chains,Well, into the bush I’ll goAnd I’ll join the bravest rankers there,Jack Donohue and co.And some dark night, when everythingIs silent in the townI’ll shoot those tyrants one and all,I’ll gun the flogger down.Oh, I’ll give the land a little shock,Remember what I say,And they’ll yet regret they’ve sent Jim JonesIn chains to Botany Bay. John BrownJohn Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore.His mama sure was proud of him!He stood straight and tall in his uniform and all.His mama’s face broke out all in a grin.“Oh son, you look so fine, I’m glad you’re a son of mine,You make me proud to know you hold a gun.Do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get,And we’ll put them on the wall when you come home.”As that old train pulled out, John’s ma began to shout,Tellin’ ev’ryone in the neighborhood:“That’s my son that’s about to go, he’s a soldier now, you know.”She made well sure her neighbors understood.She got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smileAs she showed them to the people from next door.And she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun,And these things you called a good old-fashioned war.Oh! Good old-fashioned war!Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come.They ceased to come for about ten months or more.Then a letter finally came saying, “Go down and meet the train.Your son’s a-coming home from the war.”She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere aroundBut she could not see her soldier son in sight.But as all the people passed, she saw her son at last,When she did she could hardly believe her eyes.Oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown offAnd he wore a metal brace around his waist.He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not know,While she couldn’t even recognize his face!Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face.“Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they done.How is it you come to be this way?”He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly moveAnd the mother had to turn her face away.“Don’t ou remember, Ma, when I went off to warYou thought it was the best thing I could do?I was on the battleground, you were home . . . acting proud.You wasn’t there standing in my shoes.”“Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?I’m a-tryin’ to kill somebody or die tryin’.But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came closeAnd I saw that his face looked just like mine.”Oh! Lord! Just like mine!“And I couldn’t help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink,That I was just a puppet in a play.And through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke,And a cannon ball blew my eyes away.”As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shockAt seein’ the metal brace that helped him stand.But as he turned to go, he called his mother closeAnd he dropped his medals down into her hand John Wesley HardingJohn Wesley HardingWas a friend to the poor,He trav’led with a gun in ev’ry hand.All along this countryside,He opened a many a door,But he was never knownTo hurt an honest man.‘Twas down in Chaynee County,A time they talk about,With his lady by his sideHe took a stand.And soon the situation thereWas all but straightened out,For he was always knownTo lend a helping hand.All across the telegraphHis name it did resound,But no charge held against himCould they prove.And there was no man aroundWho could track or chain him down,He was never knownTo make a foolish move.

JokermanStanding on the waters casting your breadWhile the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.Distant ships sailing into the mist,You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.Freedom just around the corner for youBut with the truth so far off, what good will it do?Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,Bird fly high by the light of the moon,Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,You rise up and say goodbye to no one.Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don’t show one.Shedding off one more layer of skin,Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within.Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,Bird fly high by the light of the moon,Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.You’re a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,Manipulator of crowds, you’re a dream twister.You’re going to Sodom and GomorrahBut what do you care? Ain’t nobody there would want to marry your sister.Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,Bird fly high by the light of the moon,Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed,Michelangelo indeed could’ve carved out your features.Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face.Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,Bird fly high by the light of the moon,Oh. oh. oh. Jokerman.Well, the rifleman’s stalking the sick and the lame,Preacherman seeks the same, who’ll get there first is uncertain.Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks,Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain,False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,Only a matter of time ‘til night comes steppin’ in.Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,Bird fly high by the light of the moon,Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.It’s a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.He’ll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,Take the motherless children off the streetAnd place them at the feet of a harlot.Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,Oh, Jokerman, you don’t show any response.Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,Bird fly high by the light of the moon,Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.

slums and trash-can alleysAnd yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe’s a-pourin’And the lightnin’s a-flashing and the thunder’s a-crashin’And the windows are rattlin’ and breakin’ and the roof tops a-shakin’And yer whole world’s a-slammin’ and bangin’And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of stormAnd to yourself you sometimes say“I never knew it was gonna be this wayWhy didn’t they tell me the day I was born”And you start gettin’ chills and yer jumping from sweatAnd you’re lookin’ for somethin’ you ain’t quite found yetAnd yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the airAnd the whole world’s a-watchin’ with a window peek stareAnd yer good gal leaves and she’s long gone a-flyingAnd yer heart feels sick like fish when they’re fryin’And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feetAnd you need it badly but it lays on the streetAnd yer bell’s bangin’ loudly but you can’t hear its beatAnd you think yer ears might a been hurtOr yer eyes’ve turned filthy from the sight-blindin’ dirtAnd you figured you failed in yesterdays rushWhen you were faked out an’ fooled white facing a four flushAnd all the time you were holdin’ three queensAnd it’s makin you mad, it’s makin’ you meanLike in the middle of Life magazineBouncin’ around a pinball machineAnd there’s something on yer mind you wanna be sayingThat somebody someplace oughta be hearin’But it’s trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer headAnd it bothers you badly when your layin’ in bedAnd no matter how you try you just can’t say itAnd yer scared to yer soul you just might forget itAnd yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer headAnd yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of leadAnd the lion’s mouth opens and yer staring at his teethAnd his jaws start closin with you underneathAnd yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behindAnd you wish you’d never taken that last detour signAnd you say to yourself just what am I doin’On this road I’m walkin’, on this trail I’m turnin’On this curve I’m hangingOn this pathway I’m strolling, in the space I’m takingIn this air I’m inhalingAm I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hardWhy am I walking, where am I runningWhat am I saying, what am I knowingOn this guitar I’m playing, on this banjo I’m frailin’On this mandolin I’m strummin’, in the song I’m singin’In the tune I’m hummin’, in the words I’m writin’In the words that I’m thinkin’In this ocean of hours I’m all the time drinkin’Who am I helping, what am I breakingWhat am I giving, what am I takingBut you try with your whole soul bestNever to think these thoughts and never to letThem kind of thoughts gain groundOr make yer heart poundBut then again you know why they’re aroundJust waiting for a chance to slip and drop down“Cause sometimes you hear’em when the night times comes creepingAnd you fear that they might catch you a-sleepingAnd you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin’And you can’t remember for the best of yer thinkingIf that was you in the dream that was screamingAnd you know that it’s something special you’re needin’And you know that there’s no drug that’ll do for the healin’And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleedingAnd you need something specialYeah, you need something special all rightYou need a fast flyin’ train on a tornado trackTo shoot you someplace and shoot you backYou need a cyclone wind on a stream engine

faceAnd by any number of bets in the bookWill be rollin’ long after the bubblegum crazeYou need something to open up a new doorTo show you something you seen beforeBut overlooked a hundred times or moreYou need something to open your eyesYou need something to make it knownThat it’s you and no one else that ownsThat spot that yer standing, that space that you’re sittingThat the world ain’t got

wordThat maybe you said or maybe you heardOn some windy corner ‘round a wide-angled curveBut that’s what you need man, and you need it badAnd yer trouble is you know it too good“Cause you look an’ you

down,Lay down the song you strum,And rest yourself ‘neath the strength of stringsNo voice can hope to hum.Struck by the sounds before the sun,I knew the night had gone.The morning breeze like a bugle blewAgainst the drums of dawn.Lay down your weary tune, lay down,Lay down the song you strum,And rest yourself ‘neath the strength of stringsNo voice can hope to hum.The ocean wild like an organ played,The seaweed’s wove its strands.The crashin’ waves like cymbals clashedAgainst the rocks and sands.Lay down your weary tune, lay down,Lay down the song you strum,And rest yourself ‘neath the strength of stringsNo voice can hope to hum.I stood unwound beneath the skiesAnd clouds unbound by laws.The cryin’ rain like a trumpet sangAnd asked for no applause.Lay down your weary tune, lay down,Lay down the song you strum,And rest yourself ‘neath the strength of stringsNo voice can hope to hum.The last of leaves fell from the treesAnd clung to a new love’s breast.The branches bare like a banjo playedTo the winds that listened best.I gazed down in the river’s mirrorAnd watched its winding strum.The water smooth ran like a hymnAnd like a harp did hum.Lay down your weary tune, lay down,Lay down the song you strum,And rest yourself ‘neath the strength of stringsNo voice can hope to hum.

Never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies’ heads,He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.He’s on some other shore, he didn’t wanna live anymore.Lenny Bruce is dead but he didn’t commit any crimeHe just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.I rode with him in a taxi once, only for a mile and a half,Seemed like it took a couple of months.Lenny Bruce moved on and like the ones that killed him, gone.They said that he was sick ‘cause he didn’t play by the rulesHe just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had. Legionnaire’s DiseaseSome say it was radiation, some say there was acid on the microphone,Some say a combination that turned their hearts to stone,But whatever it was, it drove them to their knees.Oh, Legionnaire’s disease.I wish I had a dollar for everyone that died within that year,Got ‘em hot by the collar, plenty an old maid shed a tear,Now within my heart, it sure put on a squeeze.Oh, that Legionnaire’s disease.Granddad fought in a revolutionary war, father in the War of 1812,Uncle fought in Vietnam and then he fought a war all by himself,But whatever it was, it came out of the trees.Oh, that Legionnaire’s disease. Let Me Die in My FootstepsI will not go down under the ground“Cause somebody tells me that death’s comin’ ‘roundAn’ I will not carry myself down to dieWhen I go to my grave my head will be high,Let me die in my footstepsBefore I go down under the ground.There’s been rumors of war and wars that have beenThe meaning of the life has been lost in the windAnd some people thinkin’ that the end is close by“Stead of learnin’ to live they are learning to die.Let me die in my footstepsBefore I go down under the ground.I don’t know if I’m smart but I think I can seeWhen someone is pullin’ the wool over meAnd if this war comes and death’s all aroundLet me die on this land ‘fore I die underground.Let me die in my footstepsBefore I go down under the ground.There’s always been people that have to cause fearThey’ve been talking of the war now for many long yearsI have read all their statements and I’ve not said a wordBut now Lawd God, let my poor voice be heard.Let me die in my footstepsBefore I go down under the ground.If I had rubies and riches and crownsI’d buy the whole world and change things aroundI’d throw all the guns and the tanks in the seaFor they are mistakes of a past history.Let me die in my footstepsBefore I go down under the ground.Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams floodLet me smell of wildflowers flow free through my bloodLet me sleep in your meadows with the green grassy leavesLet me walk down the highway with my brother in peace.Let me die in my footstepsBefore I go down under the ground.Go out in your country where the land meets the sunSee the craters and the canyons where the waterfalls runNevada, New Mexico, Arizona, IdahoLet every state in this union seep in your souls.And you’ll die in your footstepsBefore you go down under the ground.

License to KillMan thinks ‘cause he rules the earth he can do with it as he pleaseAnd if things don’t change soon, he will.Oh, man has invented his doom,First step was touching the moon.Now, there’s a woman on my block,She just sit there as the night grows still.She say who gonna take away his license to kill?Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for lifeAnd they set him on a path where he’s bound to get ill,Then they bury him with stars,Sell his body like they do used cars.Now, there’s a woman on my block,She just sit there facin’ the hill.She say who gonna take away his license to kill?Now, he’s hell-bent for destruction, he’s afraid and confused,And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.All he believes are his eyesAnd his eyes, they just tell him lies.But there’s a woman on my block,Sitting there in a cold chill.She say who gonna take away his license to kill?Ya may be a noisemaker, spirit maker,Heartbreaker, backbreaker,Leave no stone unturned.May be an actor in a plot,That might be all that you got‘Til your error you clearly learn.Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant poolAnd when he sees his reflection, he’s fulfilled.Oh, man is opposed to fair play,He wants it all and he wants it his way.Now, there’s a woman on my block,She just sit there as the night grows still.She say who gonna take away his license to kill?

Little Maggie, by Bob Dylan (arr) Oh, where is little MaggieOver yonder she stands,Rifle on her shoulder,Six-shooter in her hand. How can I ever stand it,Just to see them two blue eyes,Shinin’ like some diamonds,Like some diamonds in the sky. Rather be in some lonely hollowWhere the sun don’t ever shine,Than to see you be another man’s darling,And to know that you’ll never be mine. Well, it’s march me away to the stationWith my suitcase in my hand,Yes, march me away to the station,I’m off to some far-distant land. Sometimes I have a nickel,And sometimes I have a dime,Sometimes I have ten dollars,Just to pay for little Maggie’s wine. Pretty flowers are made for blooming,Pretty stars are made to shine,Pretty girls are made for boy’s love,Little Maggie was made for mine. Well, yonder stands little MaggieWith a dram glass in her hand,She’s a drinkin’ down her troublesOver courtin’ some other man. Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of HeartsThe festival was over, the boys were all plannin’ for a fall,The cabaret was quiet except for the drillin’ in the wall.The curfew had been lifted and the gamblin’ wheel shut down,Anyone with any sense had already left town.He was standin’ in the doorway lookin’ like the Jack of Hearts.He moved across the mirrored room, “Set it up for everyone,” he said,Then everyone commenced to do what they were doin’ before he turned their heads.Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,“Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts.Backstage the girls were playin’ five-card stud by the stairs,Lily had two queens, she was hopin’ for a third to match her pair.Outside the streets were fillin’ up, the window was open wide,A gentle breeze was blowin’, you could feel it from inside.Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts.Big Jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town’s only diamond mine,He made his usual entrance lookin’ so dandy and so fine.With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste.But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts.Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,She slipped in through the side door lookin’ like a queen without a crown.She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,“Sorry, darlin’, that I’m late,” but he didn’t seem to hear.He was starin’ into space over at the Jack of Hearts.“I know I’ve seen that face before,” Big Jim was thinkin’ to himself,“Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf.”But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dimAnd in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,Starin’ at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts.Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.She’d come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairsWith men in every walk of life which took her everywhere.But she’d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts.The hangin’ judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,The drillin’ in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind.It was known all around that Lily had Jim’s ringAnd nothing would ever come between Lily and the king.No, nothin’ ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts.Rosemary started drinkin’ hard and seein’ her reflection in the knife,She was tired of the attention, tired of playin’ the role of Big Jim’s wife.She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,Was lookin’ to do just one good deed before she died.She was gazin’ to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts.Lily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away.“Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you musthave known it would someday.Be careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint,I’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re lookin’ like a saint.”Down the hallway footsteps were comin’ for the Jack of Hearts.The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair.“There’s something funny going on,” he said, “I can just feel it in the air.”He went to get the hangin’ judge, but the hangin’ judge was drunk,As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk.There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts.Lily’s arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch,She forgot all about the man she couldn’t stand who hounded her so much.“I’ve missed you so,” she said to him, and he felt she was sincere,But just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear.Just another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts.No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick,The door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked.And Big Jim was standin’ there, ya couldn’t say surprised,Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes.She was with Big Jim but she was leanin’ to the Jack of Hearts.Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wallAnd cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul.In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the groundFor one more member who had business back in town.But they couldn’t go no further without the Jack of Hearts.The next day was hangin’ day, the sky was overcast and black,Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back.And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn’t even blink,The hangin’ judge was sober, he hadn’t had a drink.The only person on the scene missin’ was the Jack of Hearts.The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “Closed for repair,”Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.She was thinkin’ ‘bout her father, who she very rarely saw,Thinkin’ ‘bout Rosemary and thinkin’ about the law.But, most of all she was thinkin’ ‘bout the Jack of Hearts. Little SadieWent out last night to take a little round.I met my little Sadie and I brought her down.I ran right home and I went to bedWith a forty-four smokeless under my head.I began to think what a deed I’d done,I grabbed my hat and I began to run.I made a god run but I ran too slow;They overtook me down in JerichoStanding on a corner ringin’ my bell,Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville.He said “Young man is you name Brown?Remember the night you blowed Little Sadie down.”“Oh, yes sir, my name is Lee.I murdered little Sadie in the first degree.First degree and second degree,If you’ve got any papers will you serve them to me?”Well they took me down town and they dressed me in black.They put me on a train and they brought me back.I had no one for to go my bail;They crammed me back into the county jail.The judge and the jury they took their stand.The judge had the papers in his right hand.Forty-one days, forty-one nights;Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes Living the BluesSince you’ve been gone,I’ve been walking aroundWith my head bowed down to my shoes.I’ve been living the bluesEv’ry night without you.I don’t have to go farTo know where you are,Strangers all give me the news.I’ve been living the bluesEv’ry night without you.I think that it’s best,I soon get some restAnd forget my pride.But I can’t denyThis feeling that ICarry for you deep down inside.If you see me this way,You’d come back and you’d stay,Oh, how could you refuse.I’ve been living the bluesEv’ry night without you. Lo and Behold!I pulled out for San Anton’,I never felt so good.My woman said she’d meet me thereAnd of course, I knew she would.The coachman, he hit me for my hookAnd he asked me my name.I give it to him right away,Then I hung my head in shame.Lo and behold! Lo and behold!Lookin’ for my lo and behold,Get me outa here, my dear man!I come into PittsburghAt six-thirty flat.I found myself a vacant seatAn’ I put down my hat.“What’s the matter, Molly, dear,What’s the matter with your mound?”“What’s it to ya, Moby Dick?This is chicken town!”Lo and behold! Lo and behold!Lookin’ for my lo and behold,Get me outa here, my dear man!I bought my girlA herd of moose,One she could call her own.Well, she came out the very next dayTo see where they had flown.I’m goin’ down to Tennessee,Get me a truck ‘r somethin’.Gonna save my money and rip it up!Lo and behold! Lo and behold!Lookin’ for my lo and behold,Get me outa here, my dear man!Now, I come in on a ferris wheelAn’ boys, I sure was slick.I come in like a ton of bricks,Laid a few tricks on ‘em.Goin’ back to Pittsburgh,Count up to thirty,Round that horn and ride that herd,Gonna thread up!Lo and behold! Lo and behold!Lookin’ for my lo and behold,Get me outa here, my dear man! Lone Pilgrim, by B.F. White and Adger M. Pace I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay,And patiently stood by his tomb,When in a low whisper I heard something say:How sweetly I sleep here alone. The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roarAnd gathering storms may arise,But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,The tears are all wiped from my eyes. The call of my master compelled me from home,No kindred or relative nigh.I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,My soul flew to mansions on high. Go tell my companion and children most dearTo weep not for me now I’m gone.The same hand that led me through seas most severeHas kindly assisted me home.

Long Time GoneMy parents raised me tenderly,I was their only son.My mind got mixed with ramblin’When I was all so young,And I left my home the first timeWhen I was twelve and one.I’m a long time a-comin’, Maw,An’ I’ll be a long time gone.On the western side of Texas,On the Texas plains,I tried to find a job o’workBut they said I’s young of age.My eyes they burned when I heard,“Go home where you belong!”I’m a long time a-comin’,An’ I’ll be a long time gone.I remember when I’s ramblin’Around with the carnival trains,Different towns, different people,Somehow they’re all the same.I remember children’s faces best,I remember travelin’ on.I’m a long time a-comin’,I’ll be a long time gone.I once loved a fair young maidAn’ I ain’t too big to tell,If she broke my heart a single time,She broke it ten or twelve.I walked and talked all by myself,I did not tell no one.I’m a long time a-comin’, babe,An’ I’ll be a long time gone.Many times by the highwayside,I tried to flag a ride.With bloodshot eyes and gritting teeth,I’d watch the cars roll by.The empty air hung in my headI’s thinkin’ all day long.I’m a long time a-comin’,An’ I’ll be a long time gone.You might see me on your crossroadsWhen I’m a-passin’ through.Remember me how you wished toAs I’m a-driftin’ from your view.I ain’t got the time to think about it,I got too much to get done.Well, I’m a long time comin’An’ I’ll be a long time gone.If I can’t help somebodyWith a word or song,If I can’t show somebodyThey are travelin’ wrong.But I know I ain’t no prophetAn’ I ain’t no prophet’s son.I’m just a long time a-comin’An’ I’ll be a long time gone.So you can have your beauty,It’s skin deep and it only lies.And you can have your youth,It’ll rot before your eyes.Just give to me my gravestoneWith it clearly carved upon:“I’s a long time a-comin’,An’ I’ll be a long time gone.” Long-Distance OperatorLong-distance operator,Place this call, it’s not for fun.Long-distance operator,Please, place this call, you know it’s not for fun.I gotta get a message to my baby,You know, she’s not just anyone.There are thousands in the phone booth,Thousands at the gate.There are thousands in the phone booth,Thousands at the gate.Ev’rybody wants to make a long-distance callBut you know they’re just gonna have to wait.If a call comes from Louisiana,Please, let it ride.If a call comes from Louisiana,Please, let it ride.This phone booth’s on fire,It’s getting hot inside.Ev’rybody wants to be my friend,But nobody wants to get higher.Ev’rybody wants to be my friend,But nobody wants to get higher.Long-distance operator,I believe I’m stranglin’ on this telephone wire. Lord Protect My ChildFor his age, he’s wiseHe’s got his mother’s eyesThere’s gladness in his heartHe’s young and he’s wildMy only prayer is, if I can’t be there,Lord, protect my childAs his youth now unfoldsHe is centuries oldJust to see him at play makes me smileNo matter what happens to meNo matter what my destinyLord, protect my childWhile the world is asleepYou can look at it and weepFew things you find are worthwhileAnd though I don’t ask for muchNo material things to touchLord, protect my childHe’s young and on fireFull of hope and desireIn a world that’s been raped, raped and defiledIf I fall along the wayAnd can’t see another dayLord, protect my childThere’ll be a time I hear tellWhen all will be wellWhen God and man will be reconciledBut until men lose their chainsAnd righteousness reignsLord, protect my child Love Minus Zero/No LimitMy love she speaks like silence,Without ideals or violence,She doesn’t have to say she’s faithful,Yet she’s true, like ice, like fire.People carry roses,Make promises by the hours,My love she laughs like the flowers,Valentines can’t buy her.In the dime stores and bus stations,People talk of situations,Read books, repeat quotations,Draw conclusions on the wall.Some speak of the future,My love she speaks softly,She knows there’s no success like failureAnd that failure’s no success at all.The cloak and dagger dangles,Madams light the candles.In ceremonies of the horsemen,Even the pawn must hold a grudge.Statues made of match sticks,Crumble into one another,My love winks, she does not bother,She knows too much to argue or to judge.The bridge at midnight trembles,The country doctor rambles,Bankers’ nieces seek perfection,Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.The wind howls like a hammer,The night blows cold and rainy,My love she’s like some ravenAt my window with a broken wing.

It tolls for you and meMy pulse is runnin’ through my palmThe sharp hills are rising fromThe yellow fields with twisted oaks that groanWon’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone? Mozambique, by Bob Dylan and Jacques LevyI like to spend some time in MozambiqueThe sunny sky is aqua blueAnd all the couples dancing cheek to cheek.It’s very nice to stay a week or two.There’s lots of pretty girls in MozambiqueAnd plenty time for good romanceAnd everybody likes to stop and speakTo give the special one you seek a chanceOr maybe say hello with just a glance.Lying next to her by the oceanReaching out and touching her hand,Whispering your secret emotionMagic in a magical land.And when it’s time for leaving Mozambique,To say goodbye to sand and sea,You turn around to take a final peekAnd you see why it’s so unique to beAmong the lovely people living freeUpon the beach of sunny Mozambique Most of the TimeMost of the timeI’m clear focused all around,Most of the timeI can keep both feet on the ground,I can follow the path, I can read the signs,Stay right with it, when the road unwinds,I can handle whatever I stumble upon,I don’t even notice she’s gone,Most of the time.Most of the timeIt’s well understood,Most of the timeI wouldn’t change it if I could,I can’t make it all match up, I can hold my own,I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,I can survive, I can endureAnd I don’t even think about herMost of the time.Most of the timeMy head is on straight,Most of the timeI’m strong enough not to hate.I don’t build up illusion ‘till it makes me sick,I ain’t afraid of confusion no matter how thickI can smile in the face of mankind.Don’t even remember what her lips felt like on mineMost of the time.Most of the timeShe ain’t even in my mind,I wouldn’t know her if I saw herShe’s that far behind.Most of the timeI can’t even be sureIf she was ever with meOr if I was with her.Most of the timeI’m halfway content,Most of the timeI know exactly where I went,I don’t cheat on myself, I don’t run and hide,Hide from the feelings, that are buried inside,I don’t compromised and I don’t pretend,I don’t even care if I ever see her againMost of the time. Motorpsycho NightmareI pounded on a farmhouseLookin’ for a place to stay.I was mighty, mighty tired,I had gone a long, long way.I said, “Hey, hey, in there,Is there anybody home?”I was standin’ on the stepsFeelin’ most alone.Well, out comes a farmer,He must have thought that I was nuts.He immediately looked at meAnd stuck a gun into my guts.I fell downTo my bended knees,Saying, “I dig farmers,Don’t shoot me, please!”He cocked his rifleAnd began to shout,“You’re that travelin’ salesmanThat I have heard about.”I said, “No! No! No!I’m a doctor and it’s true,I’m a clean-cut kidAnd I been to college, too.”Then in comes his daughterWhose name was Rita.She looked like she stepped out ofLa Dolce Vita.I immediately tried to cool itWith her dad,And told him what aNice, pretty farm he had.He said, “What do doctorsKnow about farms, pray tell?”I said, “I was bornAt the bottom of a wishing well.”Well, by the dirt ‘neath my nailsI guess he knew I wouldn’t lie.“I guess you’re tired,”He said, kinda sly.I said, “Yes, ten thousand milesToday I drove.”He said, “I got a bed for youUnderneath the stove.Just one conditionAnd you go to sleep right now,That you don’t touch my daughterAnd in the morning, milk the cow.”I was sleepin’ like a ratWhen I heard something jerkin’.There stood RitaLookin’ just like Tony Perkins.She said, “Would you like to take a shower?I’ll show you up to the door.”I said, “Oh, no! no!I’ve been through this before.”I knew I had to splitBut I didn’t know how,When she said,“Would you like to take that shower, now?”Well, I couldn’t leaveUnless the old man chased me out,‘Cause I’d already promisedThat I’d milk his cows.I had to say somethingTo strike him very weird,So I yelled out,“I like Fidel Castro and his beard.”Rita looked offendedBut she got out of the way,As he came charging down the stairsSayin’, “What’s that I heard you say?”I said, “I like Fidel Castro,I think you heard me right,”And ducked as he swungAt me with all his might.Rita mumbled something‘Bout her mother on the hill,As his fist hit the icebox,He said he’s going to kill meIf I don’t get out the doorIn two seconds flat,“You unpatriotic,Rotten doctor Commie rat.”Well, he threw a Reader’s DigestAt my head and I did run,I did a somersaultAs I seen him get his gunAnd crashed through the windowAt a hundred miles an hour,And landed fully blastIn his garden flowers.Rita said, “Come back!”As he started to loadThe sun was comin’ upAnd I was runnin’ down the road.Well, I don’t figure I’ll be backThere for a spell,Even though Rita moved awayAnd got a job in a motel.He still waits for me,Constant, on the sly.He wants to turn me inTo the F.B.I.Me, I romp and stomp,Thankful as I romp,Without freedom of speech,I might be in the swamp.

Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you.Though I know that evenin’s empire has returned into sand,Vanished from my hand,Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.My weariness amazes me, I’m branded on my feet,I have no one to meetAnd the ancient empty street’s too dead for dreaming.Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to.Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you.Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin’ ship,My senses have been stripped, my hands can’t feel to grip,My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heelsTo be wanderin’.I’m ready to go anywhere, I’m ready for to fadeInto my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,I promise to go under it.Hey!

Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you.Though you might hear laughin’, spinnin’, swingin’ madly across the sun,It’s not aimed at anyone, it’s just escapin’ on the runAnd but for the sky there are no fences facin’.And if you hear vague traces of skippin’ reels of rhymeTo your tambourine in time, it’s just a ragged clown behind,I wouldn’t pay it any mind, it’s just a shadow you’reSeein’ that he’s chasing.Hey!

Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you.Then take me disappearin’ through the smoke rings of my mind,Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,Let me forget about today until tomorrow.Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to.Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you. My Back PagesCrimson flames tied through my earsRollin’ high and mighty trapsPounced with fire on flaming roadsUsing ideas as my maps“We’ll meet on edges, soon,” said IProud ‘neath heated brow.Ah, but I was so much older then,I’m younger than that now.Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth“Rip down all hate,” I screamedLies that life is black and whiteSpoke from my skull. I dreamedRomantic facts of musketeersFoundationed deep, somehow.Ah, but I was so much older then,I’m younger than that now.Girls’ faces formed the forward pathFrom phony jealousyTo memorizing politicsOf ancient historyFlung down by corpse evangelistsUnthought of, though, somehow.Ah, but I was so much older then,I’m younger than that now.A self-ordained professor’s tongueToo serious to foolSpouted out that libertyIs just equality in school“Equality,” I spoke the wordAs if a wedding vow.Ah, but I was so much older then,I’m younger than that now.In a soldier’s stance, I aimed my handAt the mongrel dogs who teachFearing not that I’d become my enemyIn the instant that I preachMy pathway led by confusion boatsMutiny from stern to bow.Ah, but I was so much older then,I’m younger than that now.Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threatsToo noble to neglectDeceived me into thinkingI had something to protectGood and bad, I define these termsQuite clear, no doubt, somehow.Ah, but I was so much older then,I’m younger than that now.

Night After NightNight after night you wander the streets of my mind.Night after night don’t know what you think you will find.No place to go, nowhere to turn,Everything around you seems to burn, burn, burn.And there’s never any mercy night after night.Night after nightNight after nightNight after night some new plan to blow up the world.Night after night another old man kissing some young girl.You look for salvation, you find none.Just another broken heart, another barrel of a gun,Just another stick of dynamite night after night.Night after nightNight after nightNight after night you drop dead in your bed,Night after night another bottle finds a head.Night after night I think about cutting you looseBut I just can’t do it, what would be the use?So I just keep a holding you tight night after night.Night after nightNight after nightNight after nightNight after night New MorningCan’t you hear that rooster crowin’?Rabbit runnin’ down across the roadUnderneath the bridge where the water flowed throughSo happy just to see you smileUnderneath the sky of blueOn this new morning, new morningOn this new morning with you.Can’t you hear that motor turnin’?Automobile comin’ into styleComin’ down the road for a country mile or twoSo happy just to see you smileUnderneath the sky of blueOn this new morning, new morningOn this new morning with you.The night passed away so quicklyIt always does when you’re with me.Can’t you feel that sun a-shinin’?Ground hog runnin’ by the country streamThis must be the day that all of my dreams come trueSo happy just to be aliveUnderneath the sky of blueOn this new morning, new morningOn this new morning with you.So happy just to be aliveUnderneath the sky of blueOn this new morning, new morningOn this new morning with you.New morning . . . No Time to ThinkIn death, you face life with a child and a wifeWho sleep-walks through your dreams into walls.You’re a soldier of mercy, you’re cold and you curse,“He who cannot be trusted must fall.”Loneliness, tenderness, high society, notoriety.You fight for the throne and you travel aloneUnknown as you slowly sinkAnd there’s no time to think.In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity,In secret, for pieces of change.The empress attracts you but oppression distracts youAnd it makes you feel violent and strange.Memory, ecstasy, tyranny, hypocrisyBetrayed by a kiss on a cool night of blissIn the valley of the missing linkAnd you have no time to think.Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want youHer worst is better than best.I’ve seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyesAnd I feel so depressed.China doll, alcohol, duality, mortality.Mercury rules you and destiny fools youLike the plague, with a dangerous winkAnd there’s no time to think.Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid youWhere the lion lies down with the lamb.I’d have paid off the traitor and killed him much laterBut that’s just the way that I am.Paradise, sacrifice, mortality, reality.But the magician is quicker and his gameIs much thicker than blood and blacker than inkAnd there’s no time to think.Anger and jealousy’s all that he sells us,He’s content when you’re under his thumb.Madmen oppose him, but your kindness throws himTo survive it you play deaf and dumb.Equality, liberty, humility, simplicity.You glance through the mirror and there’s eyes staring clearAt the back of your head as you drinkAnd there’s no time to think.Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrowWill offer their heads for a prayer.You can’t find no salvation, you have no expectationsAnytime, anyplace, anywhere.Mercury, gravity, nobility, humility.You know you can’t keep her and the water gets deeperThat is leading you onto the brinkBut there’s no time to think.You’ve murdered your vanity, buried your sanityFor pleasure you must now resist.Lovers obey you but they cannot sway youThey’re not even sure you exist.Socialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism.Fools making laws for the breaking of jawsAnd the sound of the keys as they clinkBut there’s no time to think.The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girlWith the rose in her hair.Starlight in the East and you’re finally releasedYou’re stranded but with nothing to share.Loyalty, unity, epitome, rigidity.You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille‘Neath the moon shinin’ bloody and pinkAnd there’s no time to think.Bullets can harm you and death can disarm youBut no, you will not be deceived.Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt,You can give but you cannot receive.No time to choose when the truth must die,No time to lose or say goodbye,No time to prepare for the victim that’s there,No time to suffer or blinkAnd no time to think. Not Dark YetShadows are falling and I’ve been here all dayIt’s too hot to sleep time is running awayFeel like my soul has turned into steelI’ve still got the scars that the sun didn’t healThere’s not even room enough to be anywhereIt’s not dark yet, but it’s getting thereWell my sense of humanity has gone down the drainBehind every beautiful thing there’s been some kind of painShe wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kindShe put down in writing what was in her mindI just don’t see why I should even careIt’s not dark yet, but it’s getting thereWell, I’ve been to London and I’ve been to gay PareeI’ve followed the river and I got to the seaI’ve been down on the bottom of a world full of liesI ain’t looking for nothing in anyone’s eyesSometimes my burden seems more than I can bearIt’s not dark yet, but it’s getting thereI was born here and I’ll die here against my willI know it looks like I’m moving, but I’m standing stillEvery nerve in my body is so vacant and numbI can’t even remember what it was I came here to get away fromDon’t even hear a murmur of a prayerIt’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there.

North Country BluesCome gather ‘round friendsAnd I’ll tell you a taleOf when the red iron pits ran plenty.But the cardboard filled windowsAnd old men on the benchesTell you now that the whole town is empty.In the north end of town,My own children are grownBut I was raised on the other.In the wee hours of youth,My mother took sickAnd I was brought up by my brother.The iron ore pouredAs the years passed the door,The drag lines an’ the shovels they was a-humming.‘Til one day my brotherFailed to come homeThe same as my father before him.Well a long winter’s wait,From the window I watched.My friends they couldn’t have been kinder.And my schooling was cutAs I quit in the springTo marry John Thomas, a miner.Oh the years passed againAnd the givin’ was good,With the lunch bucket filled every season.What with three babies born,The work was cut downTo a half a day’s shift with no reason.Then the shaft was soon shutAnd more work was cut,And the fire in the air, it felt frozen.‘Til a man come to speakAnd he said in one weekThat number eleven was closin’.They complained in the East,They are paying too high.They say that your ore ain’t worth digging.That it’s much cheaper downIn the South American townsWhere the miners work almost for nothing.So the mining gates lockedAnd the red iron rottedAnd the room smelled heavy from drinking.Where the sad, silent songMade the hour twice as longAs I waited for the sun to go sinking.I lived by the windowAs he talked to himself,This silence of tongues it was building.Then one morning’s wake,The bed it was bare,And I’s left alone with three children.The summer is gone,The ground’s turning cold,The stores one by one they’re a-foldin’.My children will goAs soon as they grow.Well, there ain’t nothing here now to hold them.

Only a HoboAs I was out walking on a corner one day,I spied an old hobo, in a doorway he lay.His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floorAnd I guess he’d been there for the whole night or more.Only a hobo, but one more is goneLeavin’ nobody to sing his sad songLeavin’ nobody to carry him homeOnly a hobo, but one more is goneA blanket of newspaper covered his head,As the curb was his pillow, the street was his bed.One look at his face showed the hard road he’d comeAnd a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.Only a hobo, but one more is goneLeavin’ nobody to sing his sad songLeavin’ nobody to carry him homeOnly a hobo, but one more is goneDoes it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,To look up on the world from a hole in the ground,To wait for your future like a horse that’s gone lame,To lie in the gutter and die with no name?Only a hobo, but one more is goneLeavin’ nobody to sing his sad songLeavin’ nobody to carry him homeOnly a hobo, but one more is gone Open the Door, HomerNow, there’s a certain thingThat I learned from JimThat he’d always make sure I’d understandAnd that is that there’s a certain wayThat a man must swimIf he expects to live offOf the fat of the land.Open the door, Homer,I’ve heard it said before.Open the door, Homer,I’ve heard it said beforeBut I ain’t gonna hear it said no more.Now, there’s a certain thingThat I learned from my friend, MouseA fella who always blushesAnd that is that ev’ryoneMust always flush out his houseIf he don’t expect to beGoin’ ‘round housing flushes.Open the door, Homer,I’ve heard it said before.Open the door, Homer,I’ve heard it said beforeBut I ain’t gonna hear it said no more.“Take care of all your memories”Said my friend, Mick“For you cannot relive themAnd remember when you’re out thereTryin’ to heal the sickThat you must alwaysFirst forgive them.”Open the door, Homer,I’ve heard it said before.Open the door, Homer,I’ve heard it said beforeBut I ain’t gonna hear it said no more. Only a Pawn in Their GameA bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers’ blood.A finger fired the trigger to his name.A handle hid out in the darkA hand set the sparkTwo eyes took the aimBehind a man’s brainBut he can’t be blamedHe’s only a pawn in their game.A South politician preaches to the poor white man,“You got more than the blacks, don’t complain.You’re better than them, you been born with white skin,” they explain.And the Negro’s nameIs used it is plainFor the politician’s gainAs he rises to fameAnd the poor white remainsOn the caboose of the trainBut it ain’t him to blameHe’s only a pawn in their game.The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,And the marshals and cops get the same,But the poor white man’s used in the hands of them all like a tool.He’s taught in his schoolFrom the start by the ruleThat the laws are with himTo protect his white skinTo keep up his hateSo he never thinks straight‘Bout the shape that he’s inBut it ain’t him to blameHe’s only a pawn in their game.From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks,And the hoof beats pound in his brain.And he’s taught how to walk in a packShoot in the backWith his fist in a clinchTo hang and to lynchTo hide ‘neath the hoodTo kill with no painLike a dog on a chainHe ain’t got no nameBut it ain’t him to blameHe’s only a pawn in their game.Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.They lowered him down as a king.But when the shadowy sun sets on the oneThat fired the gunHe’ll see by his graveOn the stone that remainsCarved next to his nameHis epitaph plain:Only a pawn in their game.

Ain’t gonna hang no picture,Ain’t gonna hang no picture frame.Ain’t gonna hang no picture,Ain’t gonna hang no picture frame.Well, I might look like Robert FordBut I feel just like a Jesse James.Well, I wish I was on someAustralian mountain range.Oh, I wish I was on someAustralian mountain range.I got no reason to be there, but IImagine it would be some kind of change.I got my dark sunglasses,I got for good luck my black tooth.I got my dark sunglasses,I’m carryin’ for good luck my black tooth.Don’t ask me nothin’ about nothin’,I just might tell you the truth.I got a woman in Jackson,I ain’t gonna say her name.I got a woman in Jackson,I ain’t gonna say her name.She’s a brown-skin woman,but ILove her just the same. Paths of VictoryTrails of troubles,Roads of battles,Paths of victory,I shall walk.The trail is dustyAnd my road it might be rough,But the better roads are waitingAnd boys it ain’t far off.Trails of troubles,Roads of battles,Paths of victory,We shall walk.I walked down by the river,I turned my head up high.I saw that silver linin’That was hangin’ in the sky.Trails of troubles,Roads of battles,Paths of victory,We shall walk.The evenin’ dusk was rollin’,I was walking down the track.There was a one-way wind a-blowin’And it was blowin’ at my back.Trails of troubles,Roads of battles,Paths of victory,We shall walk.The gravel road is bumpy,It’s a hard road to ride,But there’s a clearer road a-waitin’With the cinders on the side.Trails of troubles,Roads of battles,Paths of victory,We shall walk.That evening train was rollin’,The hummin’ of its wheels,My eyes they saw a better dayAs I looked across the fields.Trails of troubles,Roads of battles,Paths of victory,We shall walk.The trail is dusty,The road it might be rough,But the good road is a-waitin’And boys it ain’t far off.Trails of troubles,Roads of battles,Paths of victory,We shall walk.

Political WorldWe live in a political world,Love don’t have any place.We’re living in times where men commit crimesAnd crime don’t have a faceWe live in a political world,Icicles hanging down,Wedding bells ring and angels sing,clouds cover up the ground.We live in a political world,Wisdom is thrown into jail,It rots in a cell, is misguided as hellLeaving no one to pick up a trail.We live in a political worldWhere mercy walks the plank,Life is in mirrors, death disappearsUp the steps into the nearest bank.We live in a political worldWhere courage is a thing of the pastHouses are haunted, children are unwantedThe next day could be your last.We live in a political world.The one we can see and can feelBut there’s no one to check, it’s all a stacked deck,We all know for sure that it’s real.We live in a political worldIn the cities of lonesome fear,Little by little you turn in the middleBut you’re never why you’re here.We live in a political worldUnder the microscope,You can travel anywhere and hang yourself thereYou always got more than enough rope.We live in a political worldTurning and a’thrashing about,As soon as you’re awake, you’re trained to takeWhat looks like the easy way out.We live in a political worldWhere peace is not welcome at all,It’s turned away from the door to wander some moreOr put up against the wall.We live in apolitical worldEverything is hers or his,Climb into the frame and shout God’s nameBut you’re never sure what it is.

Restless FarewellOh all the money that in my whole life I did spend,Be it mine right or wrongfully,I let it slip gladly past the hands of my friendsTo tie up the time most forcefully.But the bottles are done,We’ve killed each oneAnd the table’s full and overflowed.And the corner signSays it’s closing time,So I’ll bid farewell and be down the road.Oh ev’ry girl that ever I’ve touched,I did not do it harmfully.And ev’ry girl that ever I’ve hurt,I did not do it knowin’ly.But to remain as friends and make amendsYou need the time and stay behind.And since my feet are now fastAnd point away from the past,I’ll bid farewell and be down the line.Oh ev’ry foe that ever I faced,The cause was there before we came.And ev’ry cause that ever I fought,I fought it full without regret or shame.But the dark does dieAs the curtain is drawn and somebody’s eyesMust meet the dawn.And if I see the dayI’d only have to stay,So I’ll bid farewell in the night and be gone.Oh, ev’ry thought that’s strung a knot in my mind,I might go insane if it couldn’t be sprung.But it’s not to stand naked under unknowin’ eyes,It’s for myself and my friends my stories are sung.But the time ain’t tall,Yet on time you depend and no word is possessedBy no special friend.And though the line is cut,It ain’t quite the end,I’ll just bid farewell till we meet again.Oh a false clock tries to tick out my timeTo disgrace, distract, and bother me.And the dirt of gossip blows into my face,And the dust of rumors covers me.But if the arrow is straightAnd the point is slick,It can pierce through dust no matter how thick.So I’ll make my standAnd remain as I amAnd bid farewell and not give a damn. Rambling, Gambling WillieCome around you rovin’ gamblers and a story I will tellAbout the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.His name was Will O’ Conley and he gambled all his life,He had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife.And it’s ride, Willie, ride,Roll, Willie, roll,Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows.He gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.He had a reputation as the gamblin’est man around,Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.And it’s ride, Willie, ride,Roll, Willie, roll,Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows.Sailin’ down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,They’re still talkin’ about their card game on that Jackson River Queen.“I’ve come to win some money,” Gamblin’ Willie says,When the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his.And it’s ride, Willie, ride,Roll, Willie, roll,Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows.Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town.And it’s ride, Willie, ride,Roll, Willie, roll,Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows.But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,He supported all his children, and all their mothers too.He wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore,He spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor.And it’s ride, Willie, ride,Roll, Willie, roll,Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows.When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knewWhether he was bluffin’ or whether he was true.He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair.The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn’t even have a pair.And it’s ride, Willie, ride,Roll, Willie, roll,Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows.It was late one evenin’ during a poker game,A man lost all his money, he said Willie was to blame.He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,When Willie’s cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.And it’s ride, Willie, ride,Roll, Willie, roll,Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows.So all you rovin’ gamblers, wherever you might be,The moral of this story is very plain to see.Make your money while you can, before you have to stop,For when you pull that dead man’s hand, your gamblin’ days are up.And it’s ride, Willie, ride,Roll, Willie, roll,Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows.

Saved, by Bob Dylan and Tim DrummondI was blinded by the devil,Born already ruined,Stone-cold deadAs I stepped out of the womb.By His grace I have been touched,By His word I have been healed,By His hand I’ve been delivered,By His spirit I’ve been sealed.I’ve been savedBy the blood of the lamb,SavedBy the blood of the lamb,Saved,Saved,And I’m so glad.Yes, I’m so glad,I’m so glad,So glad,I want to thank You, Lord,I just want to thank You, Lord,Thank You, Lord.By His truth I can be upright,By His strength I do endure,By His power I’ve been lifted,In His love I am secure.He bought me with a price,Freed me from the pit,Full of emptiness and wrathAnd the fire that burns in it.I’ve been savedBy the blood of the lamb,SavedBy the blood of the lamb,Saved,Saved,And I’m so glad.Yes, I’m so glad,I’m so glad,So glad,I want to thank You, Lord,I just want to thank You, Lord,Thank You, Lord.Nobody to rescue me,Nobody would dare,I was going down for the last time,But by His mercy I’ve been spared.Not by works,But by faith in Him who called,For so long I’ve been hindered,For so long I’ve been stalled.I’ve been savedBy the blood of the lamb,SavedBy the blood of the lamb,Saved,Saved,And I’m so glad.Yes, I’m so glad, I’m so glad,So glad, I want to thank You, Lord,I just want to thank You, Lord,Thank You, Lord. Saving GraceIf You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?Guess I owe You some kind of apology.I’ve escaped death so many times, I know I’m only livingBy the saving grace that’s over me.By this time I’d-a thought I would be sleepingIn a pine box for all eternity.My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weepingFor the saving grace that’s over me.Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection,Wherever I am welcome is where I’ll be.I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protectionIs the saving grace that’s over me.Well, the devil’s shining light, it can be most blinding,But to search for love, that ain’t no more than vanity.As I look around this world all that I’m findingIs the saving grace that’s over me.The wicked know no peace and you just can’t fake it,There’s only one road and it leads to Calvary.It gets discouraging at times, but I know I’ll make itBy the saving grace that’s over me. Seeing the Real You at LastWell, I thought that the rain would cool things downBut it looks like it don’t.I’d like to get you to change your mindBut it looks like you won’t.From now on I’ll be busy,Ain’t goin’ nowhere fast.I’m just glad it’s overAnd I’m seeing the real you at last.Well, didn’t I risk my neck for you,Didn’t I take chances?Didn’t I rise above it all for you,The most unfortunate circumstances?Well, I have had some rotten nights,Didn’t think that they would pass.I’m just thankful and gratefulTo be seeing the real you at last.I’m hungry and I’m irritableAnd I’m tired of this bag of tricks.At one time there was nothing wrong with meThat you could not fix.Well, I sailed through the stormStrapped to the mast,But the time has comeAnd I’m seeing the real you at last.When I met you, baby,You didn’t show no visible scars.You could ride like Annie Oakley,You could shoot like Belle Starr.Well, I don’t mind a reasonable amount of trouble,Trouble always comes to passBut all I care about nowIs that I’m seeing the real you at last.Well, I’m gonna quit this baby talk now,I guess I should have known.I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles,I think maybe we’d better leave each other alone.Whatever you gonna do,Please do it fast.I’m still trying to get used toSeeing the real you at last. Senor (Tales of Yankee Power)Senor, senor, do you know where we’re headin’?Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?Seems like I been down this way before.Is there any truth in that, senor?Senor, senor, do you know where she is hidin’?How long are we gonna be ridin’?How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?Will there be any comfort there, senor?There’s a wicked wind still blowin’ on that upper deck,There’s an iron cross still hanging down from around her neck.There’s a marchin’ band still playin’ in that vacant lotWhere she held me in her arms one time and said, “Forget me not.”Senor, senor, I can see that painted wagon,I can smell the tail of the dragon.Can’t stand the suspense anymore.Can you tell me who to contact here, senor?Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeledWas that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field.A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ringSaid, “Son, this ain’t a dream no more, it’s the real thing.”Senor, senor, you know their hearts is as hard as leather.Well, give me a minute, let me get it together.I just gotta pick myself up off the floor.I’m ready when you are, senor.Senor, senor, let’s disconnect these cables,Overturn these tables.This place don’t make sense to me no more.Can you tell me what we’re waiting for, senor? Seven CursesOld Reilly stole a stallionBut they caught him and they brought him backAnd they laid him down on the jailhouse groundWith an iron chain around his neck.Old Reilly’s daughter got a messageThat her father was goin’ to hang.She rode by night and came by morningWith gold and silver in her hand.When the judge he saw Reilly’s daughterHis old eyes deepened in his head,Sayin’, “Gold will never free your father,The price, my dear, is you instead.”“Oh I’m as good as dead,” cried Reilly,“It’s only you that he does craveAnd my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all.Get on your horse and ride away.”“Oh father you will surely dieIf I don’t take the chance to tryAnd pay the price and not take your advice.For that reason I will have to stay.”The gallows shadows shook the evening,In the night a hound dog bayed,In the night the grounds were groanin’,In the night the price was paid.The next mornin’ she had awokenTo know that the judge had never spoken.She saw that hangin’ branch a-bendin’,She saw her father’s body broken.These be seven curses on a judge so cruel:That one doctor will not save him,That two healers will not heal him,That three eyes will not see him.That four ears will not hear him,That five walls will not hide him,That six diggers will not bury himAnd that seven deaths shall never kill him. Series of DreamsI was thinking of a series of dreamsWhere nothing comes up to the topEverything stays down where it’s woundedAnd comes to a permanent stopWasn’t thinking of anything specificLike in a dream, when someone wakes up and screamsNothing too very scientificJust thinking of a series of dreamsThinking of a series of dreamsWhere the time and the tempo flyAnd there’s no exit in any direction‘Cept the one that you can’t see with your eyesWasn’t making any great connectionWasn’t falling for any intricate schemeNothing that would pass inspectionJust thinking of a series of dreamsDreams where the umbrella is foldedInto the path you are hurledAnd the cards are no good that you’re holdingUnless they’re from another worldIn one, numbers were burningIn another, I witnessed a crimeIn one, I was running, and in anotherAll I seemed to be doing was climbWasn’t looking for any special assistanceNot going to any great extremesI’d already gone the distanceJust thinking of a series of dreams She’s Your Lover NowThe pawnbroker roaredAlso, so, so did the landlordThe scene was so crazy, wasn’t it?Both were so gladTo watch me destroy what I hadPain sure brings out the best in people, doesn’t it?Why didn’t you just leave me if you didn’t want to stay?Why’d you have to treat me so bad?Did it have to be that way?Now you stand here expectin’ me to remember somethin’ you forgot to sayYes, and you, I see you’re still with her, wellThat’s fine ‘cause she’s comin’ on so strange, can’t you tell?Somebody had better explainShe’s got her iron chainI’d do it, but I, I just can’t remember howYou talk to herShe’s your lover now.I already assumedThat we’re in the felony roomBut I ain’t a judge, you don’t have to be nice to meBut please tell thatTo your friend in the cowboy hatYou know he keeps on sayin’ ev’rythin’ twice to meYou know I was straight with youYou know I’ve never tried to change you in any wayYou know if you didn’t want to be with meThat you could . . . didn’t have to stay.Now you stand here sayin’ you forgive and forget.

Seven DaysSeven days, seven more days she’ll be comin’I’ll be waiting at the station for her to arriveSeven more days, all I gotta do is survive.She been gone ever since I been a childEver since I seen her smile, I ain’t forgotten her eyes.She had a face that could outshine the sun in the skies.I been good, I been good while I been waitin’Maybe guilty of hesitatin’, I just been holdin’ onSeven more days, all that’ll be gone.There’s kissing in the valley,Thieving in the alley,Fighting every inch of the way.Trying to be tenderWith somebody I rememberIn a night that’s always brighter’n the day.Seven days, seven more days that are connectedJust like I expected, she’ll be comin’ on forth,My beautiful comrade from the north.There’s kissing in the valley,Thieving in the alley,Fighting every inch of the way.Trying to be tenderWith somebody I rememberIn a night that’s always brighter’n the day. She Belongs to MeShe’s got everything she needs,She’s an artist, she don’t look back.She’s got everything she needs,She’s an artist, she don’t look back.She can take the dark out of the nighttimeAnd paint the daytime black.You will start out standingProud to steal her anything she sees.You will start out standingProud to steal her anything she sees.But you will wind up peeking through her keyholeDown upon your knees.She never stumbles,She’s got no place to fall.She never stumbles,She’s got no place to fall.She’s nobody’s child,The Law can’t touch her at all.She wears an Egyptian ringThat sparkles before she speaks.She wears an Egyptian ringThat sparkles before she speaks.She’s a hypnotist collector,You are a walking antique.Bow down to her on Sunday,Salute her when her birthday comes.Bow down to her on Sunday,Salute her when her birthday comes.For Halloween give her a trumpetAnd for Christmas, buy her a drum. Shelter from the Storm‘Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and bloodWhen blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mudI came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form.“Come in,” she said,“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”And if I pass this way again, you can rest assuredI’ll always do my best for her, on that I give my wordIn a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm.“Come in,” she said,“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involvedEverything up to that point had been left unresolved.Try imagining a place where it’s always safe and warm.“Come in,” she said,“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,Poisoned in the bushes an’ blown out on the trail,Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn.“Come in,” she said,“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”Suddenly I turned around and she was standin’ thereWith silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair.She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns.“Come in,” she said,“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”Now there’s a wall between us, somethin’ there’s been lostI took too much for granted, got my signals crossed.Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn.“Come in,” she said,“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mountBut nothing really matters much, it’s doom alone that countsAnd the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn.“Come in,” she said,“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”I’ve heard newborn babies wailin’ like a mournin’ doveAnd old men with broken teeth stranded without love.Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?“Come in,” she said,“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothesI bargained for salvation an’ they gave me a lethal dose.I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn.“Come in,” she said,“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”Well, I’m livin’ in a foreign country but I’m bound to cross the lineBeauty walks a razor’s edge, someday I’ll make it mine.If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born.“Come in,” she said,“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.” Shenandoah, by Bob Dylan (arr.)Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear youLook away, you rollin’ riverOh, Shenandoah, I long to hear youLook away.

Silvio, by Bob Dylan and Robert HunterStake my future on a hell of a pastLooks like tomorrow is coming on fastAin’t complaining ‘bout what I gotSeen better times, but who has not?SilvioSilver and goldWon’t buy back the beat of a heart grown coldSilvioI gotta goFind out something only dead men knowHonest as the next jade rolling that stoneWhen I come knocking don’t throw me no boneI’m an old boll weevil looking for a homeIf you don’t like it you can leave me aloneI can snap my fingers and require the rainFrom a clear blue sky and turn it off againI can stroke your body and relieve your painAnd charm the whistle off an evening trainI give what I got until I got no moreI take what I get until I even the scoreYou know I love you and furthermoreWhen it’s time to go you got an open doorI can tell you fancy, I can tell you plainYou give something up for everything you gainSince every pleasure’s got an edge of painPay for your ticket and don’t complainOne of these days and it won’t be longGoing down in the valley and sing my songI will sing it loud and sing it strongLet the echo decide if I was right or wrongSilvioSilver and goldWon’t buy back the beat of a heart grown coldSilvioI gotta goFind out something only dead men know Simple Twist of FateThey sat together in the parkAs the evening sky grew dark,She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones.‘Twas then he felt alone and wished that he’d gone straightAnd watched out for a simple twist of fate.They walked along by the old canalA little confused, I remember wellAnd stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin’ bright.He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight trainMoving with a simple twist of fate.A saxophone someplace far off playedAs she was walkin’ by the arcade.As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin’ up,She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gateAnd forgot about a simple twist of fate.He woke up, the room was bareHe didn’t see her anywhere.He told himself he didn’t care, pushed the window open wide,Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relateBrought on by a simple twist of fate.He hears the ticking of the clocksAnd walks along with a parrot that talks,Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailers all come in.Maybe she’ll pick him out again, how long must he waitOnce more for a simple twist of fate.People tell me it’s a sinTo know and feel too much within.I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring.She was born in spring, but I was born too lateBlame it on a simple twist of fate.

Slow TrainSometimes I feel so low-down and disgustedCan’t help but wonder what’s happenin’ to my companions,Are they lost or are they found, have they counted the cost it’ll take to bringdownAll their earthly principles they’re gonna have to abandon?There’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend.I had a woman down in Alabama,She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,She said, “Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,You could die down here, be just another accident statistic.”There’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend.All that foreign oil controlling American soil,Look around you, it’s just bound to make you embarrassed.Sheiks walkin’ around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose rings,Deciding America’s future from Amsterdam and to ParisAnd there’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend.Man’s ego is inflated, his laws are outdated, they don’t apply no more,You can’t rely no more to be standin’ around waitin’In the home of the brave, Jefferson turnin’ over in his grave,Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate SatanAnd there’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend.Big-time negotiators, false healers and woman haters,Masters of the bluff and masters of the propositionBut the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,All non-believers and men stealers talkin’ in the name of religionAnd there’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend.People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are burstingOh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it.They say lose your inhibitions, follow your own ambitions,They talk about a life of brotherly love, show me someone who knows how tolive it. There’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend.Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talkin’ boy she could destroyA real suicide case, but there was nothin’ I could do to stop it,I don’t care about economy, I don’t care about astronomyBut it sure do bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets,There’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend. Something There is About YouSomething there is about you that strikes a match in meIs it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?Or is it because you remind me of something that used to beSomethin’ that crossed over from another century?Thought I’d shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youthRainy days on the Great Lakes, walkin’ the hills of old Duluth.There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black night and then there was RuthSomething there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me singsDon’t have to look no further, you’re the soul of many things.I could say that I’d be faithful, I could say it in one sweet, easy breathBut to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.Something there is about you that moves with style and graceI was in a whirlwind, now I’m in some better place.My hand’s on the sabre and you’ve picked up the batonSomethin’ there is about you that I can’t quite put my finger on.

Something’s Burning, BabySomething is burning, baby, are you aware?Something is the matter, baby, there’s smoke in your hairAre you still my friend, baby, show me a signIs the love in your heart for me turning blind? You’ve been avoiding the main streets for a long, long whileThe truth that I’m seeking is in your missing fileWhat’s your position, baby, what’s going on?Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?I know everything about this place, or so it seemsAm I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?Well, it is so obvious that something has changedWhat’s happening, baby, to make you act so strange?Something is burning, baby, here’s what I sayEven the bloodhounds of London couldn’t find you todayI see the shadow of a man, baby, makin’ you blueWho is he, baby, and what’s he to you?We’ve reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture beginsWhere charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sinsBut where do you live, baby, and where is the light?Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?I can feel it in the night when I think of youI can feel it in the light and it’s got to be trueYou can’t live by bread alone, you won’t be satisfiedYou can’t roll away the stone if your hands are tiedGot to start someplace, baby, can you explain?Please don’t fade away on me, baby, like the midnight trainAnswer me, baby, a casual look will doJust what in the world has come over you?I can feel it in the wind and it’s upside downI can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of townI’ve had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curveI don’t wanna see you bleed, I know what you need but it ain’t what you deserveSomething is burning, baby, something’s in flamesThere’s a man going ‘round calling namesRing down when you’re ready, baby, I’m waiting for youI believe in the impossible, you know that I do Song to WoodyI’m out here a thousand miles from my home,Walkin’ a road other men have gone down.I’m seein’ your world of people and things,Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.Hey, hey Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song‘Bout a funny ol’ world that’s a-comin’ along.Seems sick an’ it’s hungry, it’s tired an’ it’s torn,It looks like it’s a-dyin’ an’ it’s hardly been born.Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you knowAll the things that I’m a-sayin’ an’ a-many times more.I’m a-singin’ you the song, but I can’t sing enough,‘Cause there’s not many men that done the things that you’ve done.Here’s to Cisco an’ Sonny an’ Leadbelly too,An’ to all the good people that traveled with you.Here’s to the hearts and the hands of the menThat come with the dust and are gone with the wind.I’m a-leaving’ tomorrow, but I could leave today,Somewhere down the road someday.The very last thing that I’d want to doIs to say I’ve been hittin’ some hard travelin’ too Someone’s Got a Hold of My HeartThey say “Drink and be merry,Take the bull by the horns.”I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thornsEverything looks a little far away to meGettin’ harder and harder to recognize the trapToo much information about nothin’Too much educated rapIt’s just like you told me, just like you said it would beThe moon rising like wildfireI feel the breath of a stormSomething I got to do tonightYou go inside and stay warmSomeone’s got a hold of my heartSomeone’s got a hold of my heartSomeone’s got a hold of my heartYou-Yeah, you got a hold of my heartJust got back from a city of powder blue skiesEverybody thinks with their stomachThere’s plenty of spiesEvery street is crooked, they just wind around till they disappearMadame Butterfly, she lulls me to sleepLike an ancient riverSo wide and deepShe said, “Be easy, baby, ain’t nothin’ worth stealin’ here”You’re the one I’ve been waitin’ forYou’re the one I desireBut you must first realizeI’m not another man for hireSomeone’s got a hold of my heartSomeone’s got a hold of my heartSomeone’s got a hold of my heartYou, you, you, youYeah, you got a hold of my heartI hear the hot-blooded singerOn the bandstand croonSeptember Song, Memphis in JuneWhile they’re beating the devil out of a guy who’s wearing a flaming red wigI been to BabylonI gotta confessI can still hear that voice crying in the wildernessWhat looks large from a distance, close up is never that bigNever could learn to drink that blood and call it wineNever could learn to look at your face and call it mine.Someone’s got a hold of my heartSomeone’s got a hold of my heartSomeone’s got a hold of my heartYou-Yeah, you got a hold of my heart Spanish Harlem IncidentGypsy gal, the hands of HarlemCannot hold you to its heat.Your temperature’s too hot for taming,Your flaming feet burn up the street.I am homeless, come and take meInto reach of your rattling drums.Let me know, babe, about my fortuneDown along my restless palms.Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.I have fallen far beneathYour pearly eyes, so fast an’ slashing,An’ your flashing diamond teeth.The night is pitch black, come an’ make myPale face fit into place, ah, please!Let me know, babe, I got to know, babe,If it’s you my lifelines trace.I been wond’rin’ all about meEver since I seen you there.On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I’m riding,I know I’m ‘round you but I don’t know where.You have slayed me, you have made me,I got to laugh halfways off my heels.I got to know, babe, will I be touching youSo I can tell if I’m really real.

Talkin’ SongOne time in London I’d gone out for a walk,Past a place called Hyde park where people talk‘Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of viewTo anyone passing by, that’s who they’re talking to.There was someone on a platform talking to the folksAbout the T.V. god and all the pain that it invokes.“It’s too bright a light”, he said, “For anybody’s eyes,If you’ve never seen one it’s a blessing in disguise.”I moved in closer, got up on my toes,Two men in front of me were coming to blowsThe man was saying something ‘bout children when they’re youngBeing sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.“The news of the day is on all the time,All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme,Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,Don’t let an egg get laid in it by something you can’t see.”“Pray for peace!”. he said, you could feel it in the crowd.My thoughts began to wander. His voice was ringing loud,“It will destroy your family, your happy home is goneNo one can protect you fro it once you turn it on.”“It will ld you into some strange pursuits,Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.It will scramble up your head and drag your brain about,Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out.”“It’s all been designed”, he said, “To make you lose your mind,And when you go back to find it, there’s nothing there to find.”“Everytime you look at it, your situation’s worse,If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse.”The crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,There was pushing, there was shoving and everybody ran.The T.V. crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me,Later on that evening, I watched it on T.V..

Talkin’ World War III BluesSome time ago a crazy dream came to me,I dreamt I was walkin’ into World War Three,I went to the doctor the very next dayTo see what kinda words he could say.He said it was a bad dream.I wouldn’t worry ‘bout it none, though,They were my own dreams and they’re only in my head.I said, “Hold it, Doc, a World War passed through my brain.”He said, “Nurse, get your pad, this boy’s insane,”He grabbed my arm, I said “Ouch!”As I landed on the psychiatric couch,He said, “Tell me about it.”Well, the whole thing started at 3 o’clock fast,It was all over by quarter past.I was down in the sewer with some little loverWhen I peeked out from a manhole coverWondering who turned the lights on.Well, I got up and walked aroundAnd up and down the lonesome town.I stood a-wondering which way to go,I lit a cigarette on a parking meterAnd walked on down the road.It was a normal day.Well, I rung the fallout shelter bellAnd I leaned my head and I gave a yell,“Give me a string bean, I’m a hungry man.”A shotgun fired and away I ran.I don’t blame them too much though,I know I look funny.Down at the corner by a hot-dog standI seen a man, I said, “Howdy friend,I guess there’s just us two.”He screamed a bit and away he flew.Thought I was a Communist.Well, I spied a girl and before she could leave,“Let’s go and play Adam and Eve.”I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin’When she said, “Hey man, you crazy or sumpin’,You see what happened last time they started.”Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptownAnd there was nobody aroun’,I got into the driver’s seatAnd I drove 42nd StreetIn my Cadillac.Good car to drive after a war.Well, I remember seein’ some ad,So I turned on my Conelrad.But I didn’t pay my Con Ed bill,So the radio didn’t work so well.Turned on my player-It was Rock-A-Day, Johnny singin’,“Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa,Our Loves Are Gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah.”I was feelin’ kinda lonesome and blue,I needed somebody to talk to.So I called up the operator of timeJust to hear a voice of some kind.“When you hear the beepIt will be three o’clock,”She said that for over an hourAnd I hung it up.Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,Sayin, “Hey I’ve been havin’ the same old dreams,But mine was a little different you see.I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me.I didn’t see you around.”Well, now time passed and now it seemsEverybody’s having them dreams.Everybody sees themselves walkin’ around with no one else.Half of the people can be part right all of the time,Some of the people can be all right part of the time.But all the people can’t be all right all the timeI think Abraham Lincoln said that.“I’ll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours,”I said that. Talking New YorkRamblin’ outa the wild West,Leavin’ the towns I love the best.Thought I’d seen some ups and down,“Til I come into New York town.People goin’ down to the ground,Buildings goin’ up to the sky.Wintertime in New York town,The wind blowin’ snow around.Walk around with nowhere to go,Somebody could freeze right to the bone.I froze right to the bone.New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years;I didn’t feel so cold then.I swung on to my old guitar,Grabbed hold of a subway car,And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride,I landed up on the downtown side;Greenwich Village.I walked down there and ended upIn one of them coffee-houses on the block.Got on the stage to sing and play,Man there said, “Come back some other day,You sound like a hillbilly;We want folk singer here.”Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,Blowin’ my lungs out for a dollar a day.I blowed inside out and upside down.The man there said he loved m’ sound,He was ravin’ about how he loved m’ sound;Dollar a day’s worth.And after weeks and weeks of hangin’ around,I finally got a job in New York town,In a bigger place, bigger money too,Even joined the union and paid m’ dues.Now, a very great man once saidThat some people rob you with a fountain pen.It didn’t take too long to find outJust what he was talkin’ about.A lot of people don’t have much food on their table,But they got a lot of forks n’ knives,And they gotta cut somethin’.So one mornin’ when the sun was warm,I rambled out of New York town.Pulled my cap down over my eyesAnd headed out for the western skies.So long, New York.Howdy, East Orange. Talking Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre BluesI saw it advertised one day,Bear Mountain picnic was comin’ my way.“Come along ‘n’ take a trip,We’ll bring you up there on a ship.Bring the wife and kidsBring the whole family.”Yippee!Well, I run right down ‘n’ bought a ticketTo this Bear Mountain Picnic.But little did I realizeI was in for a picnic surprise.Had nothin’ to do with mountains.I didn’t even come close to a bear.Took the wife ‘n’ kids down to the pier,Six thousand people there,Everybody had ticket for the trip.“Oh well.” I said, “it’s a pretty big ship.Besides, anyway, the more the merrier.”Well, we all got on ‘n’ what d’ya think,That big old boat started t’ sinkMore people kept a-pilin’ on,That old ship was a-slowly goin’ down.Funny way t’ start a picnic.Well, I soon lost track of m’ kids ‘n’ wife,So many people there I never saw in m’ lifeThat old ship sinkin’ down in the water,Six thousand people tryin’ t’ kill each other,Dogs a-barkin’, cats a-meowin’,Women screamin’, fists a-flyin’, babies cryin’,Cops a-comin’, me a-runnin’.Maybe we just better call off the picnic.I got shoved down ‘n’ pushed around,All I could hear there was a screamin’ sound,Don’t remember one thing more,Just remember walkin’ up on a little shore,Head busted, stomach cracked,Feet splintered, I was bald, naked. . .Quite lucky to be alive though.Feelin’ like I climbed outa m’ casket,I grabbed back hold of m’ picnic basket.Took the wife ‘n’ kids ‘n’ started home,Wishin’ I’d never got up that morn.Now, I don’t care just what you do,If you wanta have a picnic, that’s up t’ you.But don’t tell me about it, I don’t wanta hear it,‘Cause, see, I just lost all m’ picnic spirit.Stay in m’ kitchen, have m’ own picnic. . .In the bathroom.Now, it don’t seem to me quite so funnyWhat some people are gonna do f’r money.There’s a bran’ new gimmick every dayJust t’ take somebody’s money away.I think we oughta take some o’ these peopleAnd put ‘em on a boat, send ‘em up to Bear Mountain . . .For a picnic. Tangled Up in BlueEarly one mornin’ the sun was shinin’,I was layin’ in bedWond’rin’ if she’d changed at allIf her hair was still red.Her folks they said our lives togetherSure was gonna be roughThey never did like Mama’s homemade dressPapa’s bankbook wasn’t big enough.And I was standin’ on the side of the roadRain fallin’ on my shoesHeading out for the East CoastLord knows I’ve paid some dues gettin’ through,Tangled up in blue.She was married when we first metSoon to be divorcedI helped her out of a jam, I guess,But I used a little too much force.We drove that car as far as we couldAbandoned it out WestSplit up on a dark sad nightBoth agreeing it was best.She turned around to look at meAs I was walkin’ awayI heard her say over my shoulder,“We’ll meet again someday on the avenue,”Tangled up in blue.I had a job in the great north woodsWorking as a cook for a spellBut I never did like it all that muchAnd one day the ax just fell.So I drifted down to New OrleansWhere I happened to be employedWorkin’ for a while on a fishin’ boatRight outside of Delacroix.But all the while I was aloneThe past was close behind,I seen a lot of womenBut she never escaped my mind, and I just grewTangled up in blue.She was workin’ in a topless placeAnd I stopped in for a beer,I just kept lookin’ at the side of her faceIn the spotlight so clear.And later on as the crowd thinned outI’s just about to do the same,She was standing there in back of my chairSaid to me, “Don’t I know your name?”I muttered somethin’ underneath my breath,She studied the lines on my face.I must admit I felt a little uneasyWhen she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,Tangled up in blue.She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe“I thought you’d never say hello,” she said“You look like the silent type.”Then she opened up a book of poemsAnd handed it to meWritten by an Italian poetFrom the thirteenth century.And every one of them words rang trueAnd glowed like burnin’ coalPourin’ off of every pageLike it was written in my soul from me to you,Tangled up in blue.I lived with them on Montague StreetIn a basement down the stairs,There was music in the cafes at nightAnd revolution in the air.Then he started into dealing with slavesAnd something inside of him died.She had to sell everything she ownedAnd froze up inside.And when finally the bottom fell outI became withdrawn,The only thing I knew how to doWas to keep on keepin’ on like a bird that flew,Tangled up in blue.So now I’m goin’ back again,I got to get to her somehow.All the people we used to knowThey’re an illusion to me now.Some are mathematiciansSome are carpenter’s wives.Don’t know how it all got started,I don’t know what they’re doin’ with their lives.But me, I’m still on the roadHeadin’ for another jointWe always did feel the same,We just saw it from a different point of view,Tangled up in blue. Tell MeTell me, I’ve got to know.Tell me, tell me before I go.Does that flame still burn? Does that fire still glow?Or has it died out and melted like the snow.Tell me.Tell me.Tell me, what are you focused upon?Tell me what I’ll know better when you’re gone.Tell me quick with a glance on the side.Shall I hold you close?Or Shall I let you go by?Tell me.Tell me.Are you looking at me and thinking of somebody else?Can you feel the heat and the beat of my pulse?Do you have any secrets that will come out in time?Do you lie in bed and stare at the stars?Is your main friend an acquaintance of ours?Tell me.Tell me.Tell me, do those neon lights blind your eyes?Tell me, behind what door your treasure lies.Ever gone broke in a big way?Ever gone the opposite of what the experts say?Tell me.Tell me.Is it some kind of game that you’re playin’ with me.Am I imagining something that never can be?Do you have any morals?Do you have any point of view?Do you long to ride on that old ship of Zion?What means more to you, a lap dog or a dead lion?Tell me.Tell me.Tell me, is my name in your book?Tell me, should I come back and take another look?Tell me the truth, tell me no lies.Are you someone, anyone?Tell me.Tell me.

The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas PriestWell, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest,They were the best of friends.So when Frankie Lee needed money one day,Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tensAnd placed them on a footstoolJust above the plotted plain,Sayin’, “Take your pick, Frankie Boy,My loss will be your gain.”Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right downAnd put his fingers to his chin,But with the cold eyes of Judas on him,His head began to spin.“Would ya please not stare at me like that,” he said,“It’s just my foolish pride,But sometimes a man must be aloneAnd this is no place to hide.”Well, Judas, he just winked and said,“All right, I’ll leave you here,But you’d better hurry up and chooseWhich of those bills you want,Before they all disappear.”“I’m gonna start my pickin’ right now,Just tell me where you’ll be.”Judas pointed down the roadAnd said, “Eternity!”“Eternity?” said Frankie Lee,With a voice as cold as ice.“That’s right,” said Judas Priest, “Eternity,Though you might call it ‘Paradise.’”“I don’t call it anything,”Said Frankie Lee with a smile.“All right,” said Judas Priest,“I’ll see you after a while.”Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down,Feelin’ low and mean,When just then a passing strangerBurst upon the scene,Saying, “Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler,Whose father is deceased?Well, if you are,There’s a fellow callin’ you down the roadAnd they say his name is Priest.”“Oh, yes, he is my friend,”Said Frankie Lee in fright,“I do recall him very well,In fact, he just left my sight.”“Yes, that’s the one,” said the stranger,As quiet as a mouse,“Well, my message is, he’s down the road,Stranded in a house.”Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked,He dropped ev’rything and ranUntil he came up to the spotWhere Judas Priest did stand.“What kind of house is this,” he said,“Where I have come to roam?”“It’s not a house,” said Judas Priest,“It’s not a house . . . it’s a home.”Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled,He soon lost all controlOver ev’rything which he had madeWhile the mission bells did toll.He just stood there staringAt that big house as bright as any sun,With four and twenty windowsAnd a woman’s face in ev’ry one.Well, up the stairs ran Frankie LeeWith a soulful, bounding leap,And, foaming at the mouth,He began to make his midnight creep.For sixteen nights and days he raved,But on the seventeenth he burstInto the arms of Judas Priest,Which is where he died of thirst.No one tried to say a thingWhen they took him out in jest,Except, of course, the little neighbor boyWho carried him to rest.And he just walked along, alone,With his guilt so well concealed,And muttered underneath his breath,“Nothing is revealed.”Well, the moral of the story,The moral of this song,Is simply that one should never beWhere one does not belong.So when you see your neighbor carryin’ somethin’,Help him with his load,And don’t go mistaking ParadiseFor that home across the road. The Death Of Emmett Till“Twas down in Mississippi no so long ago,When a young boy from Chicago town stepped through a Southern door.This boy’s dreadful tragedy I can still remember well,The color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till.Some men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up.They said they had a reason, but I can’t remember what.They tortured him and did some evil things too evil to repeat.There was screaming sounds inside the barn, there was laughing sounds out on the street.Then they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rainAnd they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain.The reason that they killed him there, and I’m sure it ain’t no lie,Was just for the fun of killin’ him and to watch him slowly die.And then to stop the United States of yelling for a trial,Two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till.But on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this awful crime,And so this trial was a mockery, but nobody seemed to mind.I saw the morning papers but I could not bear to seeThe smiling brothers walkin’ down the courthouse stairs.For the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free,While Emmett’s body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea.If you can’t speak out against this kind of thing, a crime that’s so unjust,Your eyes are filled with dead men’s dirt, your mind is filled with dust.Your arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains, and your blood it must refuse to flow,For you let this human race fall down so God-awful low!This song is just a reminder to remind your fellow manThat this kind of thing still lives today in that ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan.But if all of us folks that thinks alike, if we gave all we could give,We could make this great land of ours a greater place to live. The Groom’s Still Waiting at the AltarPrayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocentFelt around for the light switch, became nauseated.She was walking down the hallway while the walls deteriorated.East of the Jordan, hard as the Rock of Gibraltar,I see the burning of the page, Curtain risin’ on a new age,See the groom still waitin’ at the altar.Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your shyness for snobbery,Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to meAbout the madness of becomin’ what one was never meant to be.West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,I see the burning of the stage,Curtain risin’ on a new age,See the groom still waitin’ at the altar.Don’t know what I can say about Claudette that wouldn’t come back to haunt me,Finally had to give her up ‘bout the time she began to want me.But I know God has mercy on them who are slandered and humiliated.I’d a-done anything for that woman if she didn’t make me feel so obligated.West of the Jordan, west of the Rock of Gibraltar,I see the burning of the cage,Curtain risin’ on a new stage,See the groom still waitin’ at the altar.Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?I see people who are supposed to know better standin’ around like furniture.There’s a wall between you and what you want and you got to leap it,Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won’t have the power tokeep it.West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,I see the burning of the stage, Curtain risin’ on a new age,See the groom still waitin’ at the altar.Cities on fire, phones out of order,They’re killing nuns and soldiers, there’s fighting on the border.What can I say about Claudette?Ain’t seen her since January,She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.West of the Jordan, west of the Rock of Gibraltar,I see the burning of the stage,Curtain risin’ on a new age,See the groom still waitin’ at the altar. The Man in MeThe man in me will do nearly any task,And as for compensation, there’s little he would ask.Take a woman like youTo get through to the man in me.Storm clouds are raging all around my door,I think to myself I might not take it any more.Take a woman like your kindTo find the man in me.But, oh, what a wonderful feelingJust to know that you are near,Sets my a heart a-reelingFrom my toes up to my ears.The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein’ seen,But that’s just because he doesn’t want to turn into some machine.Took a woman like youTo get through to the man in me.

Way down in Texas many years ago,She traveled with me to ease my heavy load.Some big shot saw her ‘cause she looked so fine,How was he to know she was restless in her mindAnd the wandering kind.A strange bedfellow wandered in her roomShe was more unfaithful than I ever could assumeShe took his money and slayed him from behind‘Cause she knew she was restless in her mindShe’s the wander kind.Down at the border with new plans of my ownDon’t need no woman I’ll go it aloneI miss my baby and I can’t keep from cryin’‘Cause I know she’s restless in her mindAnd the wandering kind.I should have known better than to get mixed up with herI guess I’ll never know for sureFor better or worse the situation now is reversedAnd I’m broke ‘cause she is no longer first in my heart.I wrote this letter before leaving the hotelTo where she’s staying in that dark adobe cellI tried to help her but she knows I’m not blindAnd because I’m not restless in my mindI’m the wandering kind. The Wicked MessengerThere was a wicked messengerFrom Eli he did come,With a mind that multipliedThe smallest matter.When questioned who had sent for him,He answered with his thumb,For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter.He stayed behind the assembly hall,It was there he made his bed,Oftentimes he could be seen returning.Until one day he just appearedWith a note in his hand which read,“The soles of my feet, I swear they’re burning.”Oh, the leaves began to fallin’And the seas began to part,And the people that confronted him were many.And he was told but these few words,Which opened up his heart,“If ye cannot bring good news, then don’t bring any.” This Wheel’s on Fire, by Bob Dylan and Rick DankoIf your mem’ry serves you well,We were goin’ to meet again and wait,So I’m goin’ to unpack all my thingsAnd sit before it gets too late.No man alive will come to youWith another tale to tell,But you know that we shall meet againIf your mem’ry serves you well.This wheel’s on fire,Rolling down the road,Best notify my next of kin,This wheel shall explode!If your mem’ry serves you well,I was goin’ to confiscate your lace,And wrap it up in a sailor’s knotAnd hide it in your case.If I knew for sure that it was yours . . .But it was oh so hard to tell.But you knew that we would meet again,If your mem’ry serves you well.This wheel’s on fire,Rolling down the road,Best notify my next of kin,This wheel shall explode!If your mem’ry serves you well,You’ll remember you’re the oneThat called on me to call on themTo get you your favors done.And after ev’ry plan had failedAnd there was nothing more to tell,You knew that we would meet again,If your mem’ry served you well.This wheel’s on fire,Rolling down the road,Best notify my next of kin,This wheel shall explode! Things Have ChangedA worried man with a worried mindNo one in front of me and nothing behindThere’s a woman on my lap and she’s drinking champagneGot white skin, got assassin’s eyesI’m looking up into the sapphire tinted skiesI’m well dressed, waiting on the last trainBridge #1:Standing on the gallows with my head in a nooseAny minute now I’m expecting all hell to break looseChorusPeople are crazy and times are strangeI’m locked in tight, I’m out of rangeI used to care, but things have changedThis place ain’t doing me any goodI’m in the wrong town, I should be in HollywoodJust for a second there I thought I saw something moveGonna take dancing lessons do the jitterbug ragAin’t no shortcuts, gonna dress in dragOnly a fool in here would think he’s got anything to proveBridge #2Lot of water under the bridge, Lot of other stuff tooDon’t get up gentlemen, I’m only passing through(chorus)I’ve been walking forty miles of bad roadIf the bible is right, the world will explodeI’ve been trying to get as far away from myself as I canSome things are too hot to touchThe human mind can only stand so muchYou can’t win with a losing handBridge #3Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meetPutting her in a wheel barrow and wheeling her down the street(chorus)I hurt easy, I just don’t show itYou can hurt someone and not even know itThe next sixty seconds could be like an eternityGonna get low down, gonna fly highAll the truth in the world adds up to one big lieI’m in love with a woman who don’t even appeal to meBridge #4Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lakeI’m not that eager to make a mistake(chorus) Til I Fell In Love With YouWell my nerves are exploding and my body’s tenseI feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fenceI’ve been hit too hard; I’ve seen too muchNothing can heal me now, but your touchI don’t know what I’m gonna doI was all right ‘til I fell in love with youWell my house is on fire; burning to the skyI thought it would rain but the clouds passed byNow I feel like I’m coming to the end of my wayBut I know God is my shield and he won’t lead me astrayStill I don’t know what I’m gonna doI was all right ‘til I fell in love with youBoys in the street beginning to playGirls like birds flying awayWhen I’m gone you will remember my nameI’m gonna win my way to wealth and fameI don’t know what I’m gonna doI was all right ‘til I fell in love with youJunk is piling up; taking up spaceMy eyes feel like they’re falling off my faceSweat falling down, I’m staring at the floorI’m thinking about that girl who won’t be back no moreI don’t know what I’m gonna doI was all right ‘til I fell in love with youWell I’m tired of talking; I’m tired of trying to explainMy attempts to please you were all in vainTomorrow night before the sun goes downIf I’m still among the living, I’ll be Dixie boundI just don’t know what I’m gonna doI was all right ‘til I fell in love with you. Tight Connection to My Heart (Has Anybody Seen My Love)Well, I had to move fastAnd I couldn’t with you around my neck.I said I’d send for you and I didWhat did you expect?My hands are sweatingAnd we haven’t even started yet.I’ll go along with the charadeUntil I can think my way out.I know it was all a big jokeWhatever it was about.Someday maybeI’ll remember to forget.I’m gonna get my coat,I feel the breath of a storm.There’s something I’ve got to do tonight,You go inside and stay warm.Has anybody seen my love,Has anybody seen my love,Has anybody seen my love.I don’t know,Has anybody seen my love?You want to talk to me,Go ahead and talk.Whatever you got to say to meWon’t come as any shock.I must be guilty of something,You just whisper it into my ear.Madame ButterflyShe lulled me to sleep,In a town without pityWhere the water runs deep.She said, “Be easy, baby,There ain’t nothin’ worth stealin’ in here.”You’re the one I’ve been looking for,You’re the one that’s got the key.But I can’t figure out whether I’m too good for youOr you’re too good for me.Has anybody seen my love,Has anybody seen my love,Has anybody seen my love.I don’t know,Has anybody seen my love?Well, they’re not showing any lights tonightAnd there’s no moon.There’s just a hot-blooded singerSinging “Memphis in June,”While they’re beatin’ the devil out of a guyWho’s wearing a powder-blue wig.Later he’ll be shotFor resisting arrest,I can still hear his voice cryingIn the wilderness.What looks large from a distance,Close up ain’t never that big.Never could learn to drink that bloodAnd call it wine,Never could learn to hold you, love,And call you mine. Time Passes SlowlyTime passes slowly up here in the mountains,We sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains,Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream,Time passes slowly when you’re lost in a dream.Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-lookin’,We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cookin’,Stared out the window to the stars high above,Time passes slowly when you’re searchin’ for love.Ain’t no reason to go in a wagon to town,Ain’t no reason to go to the fair.Ain’t no reason to go up, ain’t no reason to go down,Ain’t no reason to go anywhere.Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right,Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day,Time passes slowly and fades away. Three AngelsThree angels up above the street,Each one playing a horn,Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,They’ve been there since Christmas morn.The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,Then a lady in a bright orange dress,One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,The Tenth Avenue bus going west.The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,A man with a badge skips by,Three fellas crawlin’ on their way back to work,Nobody stops to ask why.The bakery truck stops outside of that fenceWhere the angels stand high on their poles,The driver peeks out, trying to find one faceIn this concrete world full of souls.The angels play on their horns all day,The whole earth in progression seems to pass by.But does anyone hear the music they play,Does anyone even try? To Be Alone with YouTo be alone with youJust you and meNow won’t you tell me trueAin’t that the way it oughta be?To hold each other tightThe whole night throughEv’rything is always rightWhen I’m alone with you.To be alone with youAt the close of the dayWith only you in viewWhile evening slips awayIt only goes to showThat while life’s pleasures be fewThe only one I knowIs when I’m alone with you.They say that nighttime is the right timeTo be with the one you loveToo many thoughts get in the way in the dayBut you’re always what I’m thinkin’ ofI wish the night were hereBringin’ me all of your charmsWhen only you are nearTo hold me in your arms.I’ll always thank the LordWhen my working day’s throughI get my sweet rewardTo be alone with you.

To RamonaRamona, come closer,Shut softly your watery eyes.The pangs of your sadnessShall pass as your senses will rise.The flowers of the cityThough breathlike, get deathlike at times.And there’s no use in tryin’T’ deal with the dyin’,Though I cannot explain that in lines.Your cracked country lips,I still wish to kiss,As to be under the strength of your skin.Your magnetic movementsStill capture the minutes I’m in.But it grieves my heart, love,To see you tryin’ to be a part ofA world that just don’t exist.It’s all just a dream, babe,A vacuum, a scheme, babe,That sucks you into feelin’ like this.I can see that your headHas been twisted and fedBy worthless foam from the mouth.I can tell you are tornBetween stayin’ and returnin’On back to the South.You’ve been fooled into thinkingThat the finishin’ end is at hand.Yet there’s no one to beat you,No one t’ defeat you,‘Cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.I’ve heard you say many timesThat you’re better ‘n no oneAnd no one is better ‘n you.If you really believe that,You know you gotNothing to win and nothing to lose.From fixtures and forces and friends,Your sorrow does stem,That hype you and type you,Making you feelThat you must be exactly like them.I’d forever talk to you,But soon my words,They would turn into a meaningless ring.For deep in my heartI know there is no help I can bring.Everything passes,Everything changes,Just do what you think you should do.And someday maybe,Who knows, baby,I’ll come and be cryin’ to you. Train A-Travelin‘There’s an iron train a-travelin’ that’s been a-rollin’ through the years,With a firebox of hatred and a furnace full of fears.If you ever heard its sound or seen its blood-red broken frame,Then you heard my voice a-singin’ and you know my name.Did you ever stop to wonder ‘bout the hatred that it holds?Did you ever see its passengers, its crazy mixed-up souls?Did you ever start a-thinkin’ that you gotta stop that train?Then you heard my voice a-singin’ and you know my name.Do you ever get tired of the preachin’ sounds of fearWhen they’re hammered at your head and pounded in your ear?Have you ever asked about it and not been answered plain?Then you heard my voice a-singin’ and you know my name.I’m a-wonderin’ if the leaders of the nations understandThis murder-minded world that they’re leavin’ in my hands.Have you ever laid awake at night and wondered ‘bout the same?Then you heard my voice a-singin’ and you know my name.Have you ever had it on your lips or said it in your headThat the person standin’ next to you just might be misled?Does the raving of the maniacs make your insides go insane?Then you’ve heard my voice a-singin’ and you know my name.Do the kill-crazy bandits and the haters get you down?Does the preachin’ and the politics spin your head around?Does the burning of the buses give your heart a pain?Then you heard my voice a-singin’ and you know my name. Too Much of NothingNow, too much of nothingCan make a man feel ill at ease.One man’s temper might riseWhile another man’s temper might freeze.In the day of confessionWe cannot mock a soul.Oh, when there’s too much of nothing,No one has control.Say hello to ValerieSay hello to VivianSend them all my salaryOn the waters of oblivionToo much of nothingCan make a man abuse a king.He can walk the streets and boast like mostBut he wouldn’t know a thing.Now, it’s all been done before,It’s all been written in the book,But when there’s too much of nothing,Nobody should look.Say hello to ValerieSay hello to VivianSend them all my salaryOn the waters of oblivionToo much of nothingCan turn a man into a liar,It can cause one man to sleep on nailsAnd another man to eat fire.Ev’rybody’s doin’ somethin’,I heard it in a dream,But when there’s too much of nothing,It just makes a fella mean.Say hello to ValerieSay hello to VivianSend them all my salaryOn the waters of oblivion TroubleTrouble in the city, trouble in the farm,You got your rabbit’s foot, you got your good-luck charm.But they can’t help you none when there’s trouble.Trouble,Trouble, trouble, trouble,Nothin’ but trouble.Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,Go all the way to the other side of the world, you’ll find trouble there.Revolution even ain’t no solution for trouble.Trouble,Trouble, trouble, trouble,Nothin’ but trouble.Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,Persecution, execution, governments out of control.You can see the writing on the wall inviting trouble.Trouble,Trouble, trouble, trouble,Nothin’ but trouble.Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,You ever feel like you’re never alone even when there’s nobody else around?Since the beginning of the universe man’s been cursed by trouble.Trouble,Trouble, trouble, trouble,Nothin’ but trouble.Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed.Look into infinity, all you see is trouble.Trouble,Trouble, trouble, trouble,Nothin’ but trouble. Trouble In MindI got to know, Lord, when to pull back on the reins,Death can be the result of the most underrated pain.Satan whispers to ya, “Well, I don’t want to bore ya,But when ya get tired of the Miss So-and-so I got another woman for ya.”Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind,Lord, take away this trouble in mind.When the deeds that you do don’t add up to zero,It’s what’s inside that counts, ask any war hero.You think you can hide but you’re never alone,Ask Lot what he thought when his wife turned to stone.Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind,Lord, take away this trouble in mind.Here comes Satan, prince of the power of the air,He’s gonna make you a law unto yourself, gonna build a bird’s nest in your hair.He’s gonna deaden your conscience ‘til you worship the work of your own hands,You’ll be serving strangers in a strange, forsaken land.Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind,Lord, take away this trouble in mind.Well, your true love has caught you where you don’t belong,You say, “Baby, everybody’s doing it so I guess it can’t be wrong.”The truth is far from you, so you know you got to lie,Then you’re all the time defending what you can never justify.Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind,Lord, take away this trouble in mind.So many of my brothers, they still want to be the boss,They can’t relate to the Lord’s kingdom, they can’t relate to the cross.They self-inflict punishment on their own broken lives,Put their faith in their possessions, in their jobs or their wives.Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind,Lord, take away this trouble in mind.When my life is over, it’ll be like a puff of smoke,How long must I suffer, Lord, how long must I be provoked?Satan will give you a little taste, then he’ll move in with rapid speed,Lord keep my blind side covered and see that I don’t bleed. True Love Tends to ForgetI’m getting weary looking in my baby’s eyesWhen she’s near me she’s so hard to recognize.I finally realize there’s no room for regret,True love, true love, true love tends to forget.Hold me, baby be near,You told me that you’d be sincere.Every day of the year’s like playin’ Russian roulette,True love, true love, true love tends to forget.I was lyin’ down in the reeds without any oxygenI saw you in the wilderness among the men.Saw you drift into infinity and come back againAll you got to do is wait and I’ll tell you when.You’re a tearjerker, baby, but I’m under your spell,You’re a hard worker, baby, and I know you well.But this weekend in hell is making me sweat,True love, true love, true love tends to forget,True love, true love, true love tends to forget.I was lyin’ down in the reeds without any oxygenI saw you in the wilderness among the men.Saw you drift into infinity and come back againAll you got to do is wait and I’ll tell you when.You belong to me, baby, without any doubt,Don’t forsake me, baby, don’t sell me out.Don’t keep me knockin’ about from Mexico to Tibet,True love, true love, true love tends to forget. Trust YourselfTrust yourself,Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.Trust yourself,Trust yourself to do what’s right and not be second-guessed.Don’t trust me to show you beautyWhen beauty may only turn to rust.If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.Trust yourself,Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.Trust yourself,Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.Don’t trust me to show you the truthWhen the truth may only be ashes and dust.If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.Well, you’re on your own, you always were,In a land of wolves and thieves.Don’t put your hope in ungodly manOr be a slave to what somebody else believes.Trust yourselfAnd you won’t be disappointed when vain people let you down.Trust yourselfAnd look not for answers where no answers can be found.Don’t trust me to show you loveWhen my love may be only lust.If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.

UnbelievableIt’s unbelievable, it’s strange but true,It’s inconceivable it could happen to you.You go north and you go southJust like bait in the fish’s mouth.Ya must be livin’ in the shadow of some kind of evil star.It’s unbelievable it would get this far.It’s undeniable what they’d have you to think,It’s indescribable it can drive you to drink.They said it was the land of milk and honey,now they say it’s the land of money.Who ever thought they could ever make that stick.It’s unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.Bridge #1:Every head is so dignified, every moon is so sanctified,Every urge is so satisfied as long as you’re with me.All the silver, all the gold, all the sweethearts you can holdThat don’t come back with stories untold, are hanging on a tree. It’s unbelievable like a lead balloon,It’s so impossible to even learn the tune.Kill that beast and feed that swine,Scale that wall and smoke that vine,Feed that horse and saddle up the drum.It’s unbelievable, the day would finally come.Bridge #2:Once there was a man who had no eyes,Every lady in the land told him lies,He stood beneath the silver skiesAnd his heart began to bleed.Every brain is civilized,Every nerve is analyzed,Everything is criticized when you are in need.It’s unbelievable, it’s fancy-free,So interchangeable, so delightful to see.Turn your back, wash your hands,There’s always someone who understandsIt don’t matter no more what you got to sayIt’s unbelievable it would go down this way. Under the Red SkyThere was a little boy and there was a little girlAnd they lived in an alley under the red sky.There was a little boy and there was a little girlAnd they lived in an alley under the red sky. There was an old man and he lived in the moon,One summer’s day he came passing by.There was an old man and he lived in the moon,And one day he came passing by. Bridge #1:Someday little girl, everything for you is gonna be newSomeday little girl you’ll have a diamond as big as your shoeLet the wind blow low, let the wind blow high.One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie.Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high.One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie.Bridge #2:This is the key to the kingdom and this is the townThis is the blind horse that leads you aroundLet the bird sing, let the bird fly,One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry.Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,The man in the moon went home and the river went dry. Union SundownWell, my shoes, they come from Singapore,My flashlight’s from Taiwan,My tablecloth’s from Malaysia,My belt buckle’s from the Amazon.You know, this shirt I wear comes from the PhilippinesAnd the car I drive is a Chevrolet,It was put together down in ArgentinaBy a guy makin’ thirty cents a day.Well, it’s sundown on the unionAnd what’s made in the U.S.A.Sure was a good idea‘Til greed got in the way.Well, this silk dress is from Hong KongAnd the pearls are from Japan.Well, the dog collar’s from IndiaAnd the flower pot’s from Pakistan.All the furniture, it says “Made in Brazil”Where a woman, she slaved for sureBringin’ home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve,You know, that’s a lot of money to her.Well, it’s sundown on the unionAnd what’s made in the U.S.A.Sure was a good idea‘Til greed got in the way.Well, you know, lots of people complainin’ that there is no work.I say, “Why you say that forWhen nothin’ you got is U.S.-made?”They don’t make nothin’ here no more,You know, capitalism is above the law.It say, “It don’t count ‘less it sells.”When it costs too much to build it at homeYou just build it cheaper someplace else.Well, it’s sundown on the unionAnd what’s made in the U.S.A.Sure was a good idea‘Til greed got in the way.Well, the job that you used to have,They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.The unions are big business, friend,And they’re goin’ out like a dinosaur.They used to grow food in KansasNow they want to grow it on the moon and eat it raw.I can see the day coming when even your home gardenIs gonna be against the law.Well, it’s sundown on the unionAnd what’s made in the U.S.A.Sure was a good idea‘Til greed got in the way.Democracy don’t rule the world,You’d better get that in your head.This world is ruled by violenceBut I guess that’s better left unsaid.From Broadway to the Milky Way,That’s a lot of territory indeedAnd a man’s gonna do what he has to doWhen he’s got a hungry mouth to feed.Well, it’s sundown on the unionAnd what’s made in the U.S.A.Sure was a good idea‘Til greed got in the way. Under Your Spell, by Bob Dylan and Carole Bayer SagerSomething about you that I can’t shake,Don’t know how much of this I can take,Baby I’m under your spell.I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night.When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.Baby, oh what a story I could tell.It’s been nice seeing you, you read me like a bookIf you ever want to reach me, you know where to look.Baby, I’ll be at the same hotel.I’d like to help you but I’m in a bit of a jam,I’ll call you tomorrow if there’s phones where I am.Baby, caught between heaven and hell.But I will be back, I will survive,You’ll never get rid of me as long as you’re alive.Baby, can’t you tell.Well it’s four in the morning by the sound of the birds,I’m starin’ at your picture, I’m hearin’ your words.Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.Everywhere you go it’s enough to break heartsSomeone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow.I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,Don’t think I’m leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.Baby, is there anything left to tell?I’ll see you later when I’m not so out of my head,Maybe next time I’ll let the dead bury the dead.Baby, what more can I tell?Well the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,Pray that I don’t die of thirst,Baby, two feet from the well. Up to MeEverything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,Death kept followin’, trackin’ us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.Now somebody’s got to show their hand, time is an enemy,I know you’re long gone,I guess it must be up to me.If I’d thought about it I never would’ve done it, I guess I would’ve let it slide,If I’d lived my life by what others were thinkin’, the heart inside me would’ve died.I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity,Someone had to reach for the risin’ star,I guess it was up to me.Oh, the Union Central is pullin’ out and the orchids are in bloom,I’ve only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.In fourteen months I’ve only smiled once and I didn’t do it consciously,Somebody’s got to find your trail,I guess it must be up to me.It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,I’d just about convinced myself that nothin’ had changed that much.The old Rounder in the iron mask slipped me the master key,Somebody had to unlock your heart,He said it was up to me.Well, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers’ club,I would’ve followed you in the door but I didn’t have a ticket stub.So I waited all night ‘til the break of day, hopin’ one of us could get free,When the dawn came over the river bridge,I knew it was up to me.Oh, the only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerkWas to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.Was I a fool or not to try to protect your identity?You looked a little burned out, my friend,I thought it might be up to me.Well, I met somebody face to face and I had to remove my hat,She’s everything I need and love but I can’t be swayed by that.It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,But she ain’t a-gonna make me move,I guess it must be up to me.We heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,It didn’t amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.When you bite off more than you can chew you pay the penalty,Somebody’s got to tell the tale,I guess it must be up to me.Well, Dupree came in pimpin’ tonight to the Thunderbird Cafe,Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.Well, I just can’t rest without you, love, I need your company,But you ain’t a-gonna cross the line,I guess it must be up to me.There’s a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle,She’s the one you been wond’rin’ about, but there’s really nothin’ much to tell.We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history,Somebody’s got to cry some tears,I guess it must be up to me.So go on, boys, and play your hands, life is a pantomime,The ringleaders from the county seat say you don’t have all that much time.And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain’t my property,One of us has got to hit the road,I guess it must be up to me.And if we never meet again, baby, remember me,How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody.And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you, free,No one else could play that tune,You know it was up to me. Visions of JohannaAin’t it just like the night to play tricks when you’re tryin’ to be so quiet?We sit here stranded, though we’re all doin’ our best to deny itAnd Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin’ you to defy itLights flicker from the opposite loftIn this room the heat pipes just coughThe country music station plays softBut there’s nothing, really nothing to turn offJust Louise and her lover so entwinedAnd these visions of Johanna that conquer my mindIn the empty lot where the ladies play blindman’s bluff with the key chainAnd the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the “D” trainWe can hear the night watchman click his flashlightAsk himself if it’s him or them that’s really insaneLouise, she’s all right, she’s just nearShe’s delicate and seems like the mirrorBut she just makes it all too concise and too clearThat Johanna’s not hereThe ghost of ‘lectricity howls in the bones of her faceWhere these visions of Johanna have now taken my placeNow, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriouslyHe brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerouslyAnd when bringing her name upHe speaks of a farewell kiss to meHe’s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and allMuttering small talk at the wall while I’m in the hallHow can I explain?Oh, it’s so hard to get onAnd these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawnInside the museums, Infinity goes up on trialVoices echo this is what salvation must be like after a whileBut Mona Lisa musta had the highway bluesYou can tell by the way she smilesSee the primitive wallflower freezeWhen the jelly-faced women all sneezeHear the one with the mustache say, “JeezeI can’t find my knees”Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the muleBut these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruelThe peddler now speaks to the countess who’s pretending to care for himSayin’, “Name me someone that’s not a parasite and I’ll go out and say a prayer for him”But like Louise always says“Ya can’t look at much, can ya man?”As she, herself, prepares for himAnd Madonna, she still has not showedWe see this empty cage now corrodeWhere her cape of the stage once had flowedThe fiddler, he now steps to the roadHe writes ev’rything’s been returned which was owedOn the back of the fish truck that loadsWhile my conscience explodesThe harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rainAnd these visions of Johanna are now all that remain Walkin’ Down the LineWell, I’m walkin’ down the line,I’m walkin’ down the lineAn’ I’m walkin’ down the line.My feet’ll be a-flyin’To tell about my troubled mind.I got a heavy-headed galI got a heavy-headed galI got a heavy-headed galShe ain’t feelin’ wellWhen she’s better only time will tellWell, I’m walkin’ down the line,I’m walkin’ down the lineAn’ I’m walkin’ down the line.My feet’ll be a-flyin’To tell about my troubled mind.My money comes and goesMy money comes and goesMy money comes and goesAnd rolls and flows and rolls and flowsThrough the holes in the pockets in my clothesWell, I’m walkin’ down the line,I’m walkin’ down the lineAn’ I’m walkin’ down the line.My feet’ll be a-flyin’To tell about my troubled mind.I see the morning lightI see the morning lightWell it’s not becauseI’m an early riserI didn’t go to sleep last nightWell, I’m walkin’ down the line,I’m walkin’ down the lineAn’ I’m walkin’ down the line.My feet’ll be a-flyin’To tell about my troubled mind.I got my walkin’ shoesI got my walkin’ shoesI got my walkin’ shoesAn’ I ain’t a-gonna loseI believe I got the walkin’ bluesWell, I’m walkin’ down the line,I’m walkin’ down the lineAn’ I’m walkin’ down the line.My feet’ll be a-flyin’To tell about my troubled mind. Walk Out In The Rain, by Bob Dylan and Helena SpringsWalk out if it doesn’t feel right,I can tell you’re only lying.If you got something better tonight,Don’t mess up my mind with your crying.Walk out in the rain,Walk out with your dreams,Walk out of my lifeIf it doesn’t feel rightAnd catch the next train.Oh, darling, walk out in the rain.I have come from so far awayJust to put a ring on your finger.You’ve said all that you’ve got to say,So please don’t feel the need to linger.Walk out in the rain,Walk out with your dreams,Walk out of my lifeIf it doesn’t feel rightAnd catch the next train.Oh, darling, walk out in the rain.It’s rainin’ inside of the city,My poor feet have walked ‘til they’re sore.If you don’t want my love, it’s a pity,I guess I can’t see you no more.Walk out in the rain,Walk out with your dreams,Walk out of my lifeIf it doesn’t feel rightAnd catch the next train.Oh, darling, walk out in the rain. Walls of Red WingOh, the age of the inmatesI remember quite freely:No younger than twelve,No older ‘n seventeen.Thrown in like banditsAnd cast off like criminals,Inside the walls,The walls of Red Wing.From the dirty old mess hallYou march to the brick wall,Too weary to talkAnd too tired to sing.Oh, it’s all afternoonYou remember your home town,Inside the walls,The walls of Red Wing.Oh, the gates are cast ironAnd the walls are barbed wire.Stay far from the fenceWith the ‘lectricity sting.And it’s keep down your headAnd stay in your number,Inside the walls,The walls of Red Wing.Oh, it’s fare thee wellTo the deep hollow dungeon,Farewell to the boardwalkThat takes you to the screen.And farewell to the minutesThey threaten you with it,Inside the walls,The walls of Red Wing.It’s many a guardThat stands around smilin’,Holdin’ his clubLike he was a king.Hopin’ to get youBehind a wood pilin’,Inside the walls,The walls of Red Wing.The night aimed shadowsThrough the crossbar windows,And the wind punched hardTo make the wall-siding sing.It’s many a night I pretended to be a-sleepin’,Inside the walls,The walls of Red Wing.As the rain rattled heavyOn the bunk-house shingles,And the sounds in the night,They made my ears ring.‘Til the keys of the guardsClicked the tune of the morning,Inside the walls,The walls of Red Wing.Oh, some of us’ll end upIn St. Cloud Prison,And some of us’ll wind upTo be lawyers and things,And some of us’ll stand upTo meet you on your crossroads,From inside the walls,The walls of Red Wing. WallflowerWallflower, wallflowerWon’t you dance with me?I’m sad and lonely too.Wallflower, wallflowerWon’t you dance with me?I’m fallin’ in love with you.Just like you I’m wondrin’ what I’m doin’ here.Just like you I’m wondrin’ what’s goin’ on.Wallflower, wallflowerWon’t you dance with me?The night will soon be gone.I have seen you standing in the smoky hazeAnd I know that you’re gonna be mine one of these days,Mine alone.Wallflower, wallflowerTake a chance on me.Please let me ride you home. Watching the River FlowWhat’s the matter with me,I don’t have much to say,Daylight sneakin’ through the windowAnd I’m still in this all-night cafe.Walkin’ to and fro beneath the moonOut to where the trucks are rollin’ slow,To sit down on this bank of sandAnd watch the river flow.Wish I was back in the cityInstead of this old bank of sand,With the sun beating down over the chimney topsAnd the one I love so close at hand.If I had wings and I could fly,I know where I would go.But right now I’ll just sit here so contentedlyAnd watch the river flow.People disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah,Makes you stop and all wonder why.Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the streetWho just couldn’t help but cry.Oh, this ol’ river keeps on rollin’, though,No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow,And as long as it does I’ll just sit hereAnd watch the river flow.People disagreeing everywhere you look,Makes you wanna stop and read a book.Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the streetThat was really shook.But this ol’ river keeps on rollin’, though,No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow,And as long as it does I’ll just sit hereAnd watch the river flow.Watch the river flow,Watchin’ the river flow,Watchin’ the river flow,But I’ll sit down on this bank of sandAnd watch the river flow.

Watered Down LoveLove that’s pure hopes all things,Believes all things, won’t pull no strings,Won’t sneak up into your room, tall, dark and handsome,Capture your heart and hold it for ransom.You don’t want a love that’s pureYou wanna drown loveYou want a watered-down loveLove that’s pure, it don’t make no claims,Intercedes for you ‘stead of casting you blame,Will not deceive you or lead you to transgression,Won’t write it up and make you sign a false confession.You don’t want a love that’s pureYou wanna drown loveYou want a watered-down loveLove that’s pure won’t lead you astray,Won’t hold you back, won’t mess up your day,Won’t pervert you, corrupt you with stupid wishes,It don’t make you envious, it don’t make you suspicious.You don’t want a love that’s pureYou wanna drown loveYou want a watered-down loveLove that’s pure ain’t no accident,Always on time, is always content,An eternal flame, quietly burning,Never needs to be proud, restlessly yearning.You don’t want a love that’s pureYou wanna drown loveYou want a watered-down love We Better Talk This OverI think we better talk this overMaybe when we both get soberYou’ll understand I’m only a manDoin’ the best that I can.This situation can only get rougher.Why should we needlessly suffer?Let’s call it a day, go our own different waysBefore we decay.You don’t have to be afraid of looking into my face,We’ve done nothing to each other time will not erase.I feel displaced, I got a low-down feelingYou been two-faced, you been double-dealing.I took a chance, got caught in the tranceOf a downhill dance.Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?I’m exiled, you can’t convert me.I’m lost in the haze of your delicate waysWith both eyes glazed.You don’t have to yearn for love, you don’t have to be alone,Somewheres in this universe there’s a place that you can call home.I guess I’ll be leaving tomorrowIf I have to beg, steal or borrow.It’d be great to cross paths in a day and a halfLook at each other and laugh.But I don’t think it’s liable to happenLike the sound of one hand clappin’.The vows that we kept are now broken and swept‘Neath the bed where we slept.Don’t think of me and fantasize on what we never had,Be grateful for what we’ve shared together and be glad.Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?Eventually we’ll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.Oh, babe, time for a new transitionI wish I was a magician.I would wave a wand and tie back the bondThat we’ve both gone beyond. What Can I Do For You?You have given everything to me.What can I do for You?You have given me eyes to see.What can I do for You?Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,Filled up a hunger that had always been denied,Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wideAnd You’ve chosen me to be among the few.What can I do for You?You have laid down Your life for me.What can I do for You?You have explained every mystery.What can I do for You?Soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly,He gets wise in his own eyes and he’s made to believe a lie.Who would deliver him from the death he’s bound to die?Well, You’ve done it all and there’s no more anyone can pretend to do.What can I do for You?You have given all there is to give.What can I do for You?You have given me life to live.How can I live for You?I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,I don’t care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart.Well, I don’t deserve it but I sure did make it through.What can I do for You? Wedding SongI love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,I love you more than money and more than the stars above,Love you more than madness, more than waves upon the sea,Love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.Ever since you walked right in, the circle’s been complete,I’ve said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun,I love you more than ever and I haven’t yet begun.You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give,Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole,Quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul.You gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life,Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,My thoughts of you don’t ever rest, they’d kill me if I lie,I’d sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die.The tune tat is yours and mine to play upon this earth,We’ll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth,What’s lost is lost, we can’t regain what went down in the flood,But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.It’s never been my duty to remake the world at large,Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge,‘Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn’t bend,And if there is eternity I’d love you there again.Oh, can’t you see that you were born to stand by my sideAnd I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride,You’re the other half of what I am, you’re the missing pieceAnd I love you more than ever with that love that doesn’t cease.You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,Just bein’ next to you is a natural thing for meAnd I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,‘Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone. Went to See the GypsyWent to see the gypsy,Stayin’ in a big hotel.He smiled when he saw me coming,And he said, “Well, well, well.”His room was dark and crowded,Lights were low and dim.“How are you?” he said to me,I said it back to him.I went down to the lobbyTo make a small call out.A pretty dancing girl was there,And she began to shout,“Go on back to see the gypsy.He can move you from the rear,Drive you from your fear,Bring you through the mirror.He did it in Las Vegas,And he can do it here.”Outside the lights were shiningOn the river of tears,I watched them from the distanceWith music in my ears.I went back to see the gypsy,It was nearly early dawn.The gypsy’s door was open wideBut the gypsy was gone,And that pretty dancing girl,She could not be found.So I watched that sun come risingFrom that little Minnesota town. What Good Am I?What good am I if I’m like all the rest,If I just turned away, when I see how you’re dressed,If I shut myself off so I can’t hear you cry,What good am I?What good am I if I know and don’t do,If I see and don’t say, if I look right through you,If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin’ sky,What good am I?What good am I while you softly weepAnd I hear in my head what you say in your sleep,And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don’t try,What good am I?What good am I then to others and meIf I’ve had every chance and yet still fail to seeBridge: If my hands tied must I not wonder withinWho tied them and why and where must I have beenWhat good am I if I say foolish thingsAnd I laugh in the face of what sorrow bringsAnd I just turn my back while you silently die,What good am I? When He ReturnsThe iron hand it ain’t no match for the iron rod,The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty God.For all those who have eyes and all those who have earsIt is only He who can reduce me to tears.Don’t you cry and don’t you die and don’t you burnFor like a thief in the night, He’ll replace wrong with rightWhen He returns.Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?Will I ever learn that there’ll be no peace, that the war won’t ceaseUntil He returns?Surrender your crown on this blood-stained ground, take off your mask,He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.How long can you falsify and deny what is real?How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?Of every earthly plan that be known to man, He is unconcerned,He’s got plans of His own to set up His throneWhen He returns. Whatcha Gonna DoTell me what you’re gonna doWhen the shadow comes under your door.Tell me what you’re gonna doWhen the shadow comes under your door.Tell me what you’re gonna doWhen the shadow comes under your door.O Lord, O Lord,What shall you do?Tell me what you’re gonna doWhen the devil calls your cards.Tell me what you’re gonna doWhen the devil calls your cards.Tell me what you’re gonna doWhen the devil calls your cards.O Lord, O Lord,What shall you do?Tell me what you’re gonna doWhen your water turns to wine.Tell me what you’re gonna doWhen your water turns to wine.Tell me what you’re gonna doWhen your water turns to wine.O Lord, O Lord,What should you do?Tell me what you’re gonna doWhen you can’t play God no more.Tell me what you’re gonna doWhen you can’t play God no more.Tell me what you’re gonna doWhen you can’t play God no more.O Lord, O Lord,What shall you do?Tell me what you’re gonna doWhen the shadow comes creepin’ in your room.Tell me what you’re gonna doWhen the shadow comes creepin’ in your room.Tell me what you’re gonna doWhen the shadow comes creepin’ in your room.O Lord, O Lord,What should you do? What Was It You Wanted?What was it you wanted?Tell me again so I’ll know.What’s happening in there,What’s going on in your show.What was it you wanted,Could you say it again?I’ll be back in a minuteYou can get it together by then. What was it you wantedYou can tell me, I’m back,We can start it all overGet it back on the track,You got my attention,Go ahead, speak.What was it you wantedWhen you were kissing my cheek?Was there somebody lookingWhen you give me that kissSomeone there in the shadowsSomeone that I might have missed?Is there something you needed,Something I don’t understand.What was it you wanted,Do I have it here in my hand?Whatever you wantedSlipped out of my mind,Would you remind me againIf you’d be so kind.Has the record been breaking,Did the needle just skip,Is there somebody waitin’,Was there a slip of the lip?What was it you wantedI ain’t keepin’ scoreAre you the same personThat was here before?Is it something important?Maybe not.What was it you wanted?Tell me again I forgot.Whatever you wantedWhat could it beDid somebody tell youThat you could get it from me,Is it something that comes naturalIs it easy to say,Why do you want it,Who are you anyway?Is the scenery changing,Am I getting it wrong,Is the whole thing going backwards,Are they playing our song?Where were you when it startedDo you want it for freeWhat was it you wantedAre you talking to me? When the Night Comes Falling from the SkyLook out across the fields, see me returning,Smoke is in your eye, you draw a smile.From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,You’ve had time to think about it for a while.Well, I’ve walked two hundred miles, now look me over,It’s the end of the chase and the moon is high.It won’t matter who loves who,You’ll love me or I’ll love youWhen the night comes falling from the sky.I can see through your walls and I know you’re hurting,Sorrow covers you up like a cape.Only yesterday I know that you’ve been flirtingWith disaster that you managed to escape.I can’t provide for you no easy answers,Who are you that I should have to lie?You’ll know all about it, love,It’ll fit you like a gloveWhen the night comes falling from the sky.I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,You must have been protecting someone last time I called.I’ve never asked you for nothing you couldn’t deliver,I’ve never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,For the love of a lousy buck, I’ve watched them die.Stick around, baby, we’re not through,Don’t look for me, I’ll see youWhen the night comes falling from the sky.In your teardrops, I can see my own reflection,It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line.I don’t want to be a fool starving for affection,I don’t want to drown in someone else’s wine.For all eternity I think I will rememberThat icy wind that’s howling in your eye.You will seek me and you’ll find me In the wasteland of your mindWhen the night comes falling from the sky.Well, I sent you my feelings in a letterBut you were gambling for support.This time tomorrow I’ll know you betterWhen my memory is not so shortThis time I’m asking for freedom,Freedom from a world which you deny.And you’ll give it to me now,I’ll take it anyhowWhen the night comes falling from the sky. When I Paint My MasterpieceOh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,Ancient footprints are everywhere.You can almost think that you’re seein’ doubleOn a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,Where I’ve got me a date with Botticelli’s niece.She promised that she’d be right there with meWhen I paint my masterpiece.Oh, the hours I’ve spent inside the Coliseum,Dodging lions and wastin’ time.Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see ‘em,Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.Train wheels runnin’ through the back of my memory,When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese.Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsodyWhen I paint my masterpiece.Sailin’ ‘round the world in a dirty gondola.Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola!I left Rome and landed in Brussels,On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried.Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin’ muscles,Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside.Newspapermen eating candyHad to be held down by big police.Someday, everything is gonna be diff’rentWhen I paint my masterpiece. When the Ship Comes InOh the time will come upWhen the winds will stopAnd the breeze will cease to be breathin’.Like the stillness in the wind‘Fore the hurricane begins,The hour when the ship comes in.Oh the seas will splitAnd the ship will hitAnd the sands on the shoreline will be shaking.Then the tide will soundAnd the wind will poundAnd the morning will be breaking.Oh the fishes will laughAs they swim out of the pathAnd the seagulls they’ll be smiling.And the rocks on the sandWill proudly stand,The hour that the ship comes in.And the words that are usedFor to get the ship confusedWill not be understood as they’re spoken.For the chains of the seaWill have busted in the nightAnd will be buried at the bottom of the ocean.A song will liftAs the mainsail shiftsAnd the boat drifts on to the shoreline.And the sun will respectEvery face on the deck,The hour that the ship comes in.Then the sands will rollOut a carpet of goldFor your weary toes to be a-touchin’.And the ship’s wise menWill remind you once againThat the whole wide world is watchin’.Oh the foes will riseWith the sleep still in their eyesAnd they’ll jerk from their beds and think they’re dreamin’.But they’ll pinch themselves and squealAnd know that it’s for real,The hour when the ship comes in.Then they’ll raise their hands,Sayin’ we’ll meet all your demands,But we’ll shout from the bow your days are numbered.And like Pharaoh’s tribe,They’ll be drownded in the tide,And like Goliath, they’ll be conquered. Where Teardrops FallFar Away where the soft wind blow,Far away from it all,There is a place you goWhere teardrops fall.Far away in the stormy night,Far away and over the wall,You are there in the flickering lightWhere teardrops fall.We banged the drum slowlyAnd played the fife lowlyYou know the song in my heartBridge: In the turning of twilightIn the shadows of moonlightYou can show me a new place to startI’ve torn my clothes and I’ve drained the cupStrippin’ away at it all,Thinking of you when the sun comes upWhere teardrops fall.By rivers of blindness,In love and with kindnessWe could hold up a toast if we meetBridge: To the cuttin’ of fencesTo sharpen the sensesThat linger in the fireball heat.Roses are red, violets are blueAnd time is beginning to crawl,I just might have to come see youWhere teardrops fall. Where Are You Tonight?There’s a long-distance train rolling through the rain, tears on the letter I write.There’s a woman I long to touch and I miss her so much but she’s drifting like asatellite. There’s a neon light ablaze in this green smoky haze, laughter down onElizabeth StreetAnd a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone where she bathed in a stream of pureheat. Her father would emphasize you got to be more than street-wise but he practicedwhat he preached from the heart.A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted to me the time and the place that the trouble would start.There’s a babe in the arms of a woman in a rageAnd a longtime golden-haired stripper onstageAnd she winds back the clock and she turns back the pageOf a book that no one can write.Oh, where are you tonight?The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure, to live it you have to explode.In that last hour of need, we entirely agreed, sacrifice was the code of the road.I left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John, strong men belittled by doubt.I couldn’t tell her what my private thoughts were but she had some way of findingthem out. He took dead-center aim but he missed just the same, she was waiting,putting flowers on the shelf.She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair and discovered her invisible self.There’s a lion in the road, there’s a demon escaped,There’s a million dreams gone, there’s a landscape being raped,As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape,I won’t, but then again, maybe I might.Oh, if I could just find you tonight.I fought with my twin, that enemy within, ‘til both of us fell by the way.Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees while the law looks the other way.Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes, the guy you were lovin’couldn’t stay clean.It felt outa place, my foot in his face, but he should-a stayed where his money wasgreen.I bit into the root of forbidden fruit with the juice running down my leg.Then I dealt with your boss, who’d never known about loss and who always wastoo proud to beg.There’s a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room and a pathway that leadsup to the stars.If you don’t believe there’s a price for this sweet paradise, remind me to show you thescars.There’s a new day at dawn and I’ve finally arrived.If I’m there in the morning, baby, you’ll know I’ve survived.I can’t believe it, I can’t believe I’m alive,But without you it just doesn’t seem right.Oh, where are you tonight? Who Killed Davey Moore?Who killed Davey Moore,Why an’ what’s the reason for?“Not I,” says the referee,“Don’t point your finger at me.I could’ve stopped it in the eighthAn’ maybe kept him from his fate,But the crowd would’ve booed, I’m sure,At not gettin’ their money’s worth.It’s too bad he had to go,But there was a pressure on me too, you know.It wasn’t me that made him fall.No, you can’t blame me at all.”Who killed Davey Moore,Why an’ what’s the reason for?“Not us,” says the angry crowd,Whose screams filled the arena loud.“It’s too bad he died that nightBut we just like to see a fight.We didn’t mean for him t’ meet his death,We just meant to see some sweat,There ain’t nothing wrong in that.It wasn’t us that made him fall.No, you can’t blame us at all.”Who killed Davey Moore,Why an’ what’s the reason for?“Not me,” says his manager,Puffing on a big cigar.“It’s hard to say, it’s hard to tell,I always thought that he was well.It’s too bad for his wife an’ kids he’s dead,But if he was sick, he should’ve said.It wasn’t me that made him fall.No, you can’t blame me at all.”Who killed Davey Moore,Why an’ what’s the reason for?“Not me,” says the gambling man,With his ticket stub still in his hand.“It wasn’t me that knocked him down,My hands never touched him none.I didn’t commit no ugly sin,Anyway, I put money on him to win.It wasn’t me that made him fall.No, you can’t blame me at all.”Who killed Davey Moore,Why an’ what’s the reason for?“Not me,” says the boxing writer,Pounding print on his old typewriter,Sayin’, “Boxing ain’t to blame,There’s just as much danger in a football game.”Sayin’, “Fist fighting is here to stay,It’s just the old American way.It wasn’t me that made him fall.No, you can’t blame me at all.”Who killed Davey Moore,Why an’ what’s the reason for?“Not me,” says the man whose fistsLaid him low in a cloud of mist,Who came here from Cuba’s doorWhere boxing ain’t allowed no more.“I hit him, yes, it’s true,But that’s what I am paid to do.Don’t say ‘murder,’ don’t say ‘kill.’It was destiny, it was God’s will.”Who killed Davey Moore,Why an’ what’s the reason for? Wiggle WiggleWiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle ‘til the moon is blue,Wiggle ‘til the moon sees you.Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, like a swarm of bees,Wiggle on your hands and knees.Bridge #1:Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,Wiggle ‘til you wiggle right out of here,Wiggle ‘til it opens, wiggle ‘til it shuts,Wiggle ‘til it bites, wiggle ‘til it cuts.Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,Wiggle - you can raise the dead.Bridge #2:Wiggle ‘til you’re high, wiggle ‘til you’re higher,Wiggle ‘til you vomit fire,Wiggle ‘til it whispers, wiggle ‘til it hums,Wiggle ‘til it answers, wiggle ‘til it comes.Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,Wiggle like a big fat snake. When You Gonna Wake Up?God don’t make no promises that He don’t keep.You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake upWhen you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts.Karl Marx has got ya by the throat, Henry Kissinger’s got you tied up in knots.When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake upWhen you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that’ll never cure your ills.When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake upWhen you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?You got men who can’t hold their peace and women who can’t control their tongues,The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake upWhen you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake upWhen you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,Instant inner peace and every step you take has got to be approved.When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake upWhen you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?Do you ever wonder just what God requires?You think He’s just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires.When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake upWhen you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?You can’t take it with you and you know that it’s too worthless to be sold,They tell you, “Time is money” as if your life was worth its weight in gold.When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake upWhen you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?There’s a Man up on a cross and He’s been crucified.Do you have any idea why or for who He died?When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake upWhen you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain? WinterludeWinterlude, Winterlude, oh darlin’,Winterlude by the road tonight.Tonight there will be no quarrelin’,Ev’rything is gonna be all right.Oh, I see by the angel beside meThat love has a reason to shine.You’re the one I adore, come over here and give me more,Then Winterlude, this dude thinks you’re fine.Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,Winterlude by the corn in the field,Winterlude, let’s go down to the chapel,Then come back and cook up a meal.Well, come out when the skating rink glistensBy the sun, near the old crossroads sign.The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold,Winterlude, don’t be rude, please be mine.Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,Winterlude by the telephone wire,Winterlude, it’s makin’ me lazy,Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.The moonlight reflects from the windowWhere the snowflakes, they cover the sand.Come out tonight, ev’rything will be tight,Winterlude, this dude thinks you’re grand. With God on Our SideOh my name it is nothin’My age it means lessThe country I come fromIs called the MidwestI’s taught and brought up thereThe laws to abideAnd that land that I live inHas God on its side.Oh the history books tell itThey tell it so wellThe cavalries chargedThe Indians fellThe cavalries chargedThe Indians diedOh the country was youngWith God on its side.Oh the Spanish-AmericanWar had its dayAnd the Civil War tooWas soon laid awayAnd the names of the heroesI’s made to memorizeWith guns in their handsAnd God on their side.Oh the First World War, boysIt closed out its fateThe reason for fightingI never got straightBut I learned to accept itAccept it with prideFor you don’t count the deadWhen God’s on your side.When the Second World WarCame to an endWe forgave the GermansAnd we were friendsThough they murdered six millionIn the ovens they friedThe Germans now tooHave God on their side.I’ve learned to hate RussiansAll through my whole lifeIf another war startsIt’s them we must fightTo hate them and fear themTo run and to hideAnd accept it all bravelyWith God on my side.But now we got weaponsOf the chemical dustIf fire them we’re forced toThen fire them we mustOne push of the buttonAnd a shot the world wideAnd you never ask questionsWhen God’s on your side.In a many dark hourI’ve been thinkin’ about thisThat Jesus ChristWas betrayed by a kissBut I can’t think for youYou’ll have to decideWhether Judas IscariotHad God on his side.So now as I’m leavin’I’m weary as HellThe confusion I’m feelin’Ain’t no tongue can tellThe words fill my headAnd fall to the floorIf God’s on our sideHe’ll stop the next war. World Gone Wrong, by Bob Dylan (arr) 1.Strange things have happened, like never before.My baby told me I would have to go.I can’t be good no more, once like I did before.I can’t be good, baby,Honey, because the world’s gone wrong. Feel bad this morning, ain’t got no home.No use in worrying, ‘cause the world gone wrong,I can’t be good no more, once like I did before.I can’t be good, baby,Honey, because the world’s gone wrong. I told you, baby, right to your head,If I didn’t leave you I would have to kill you dead.I can’t be good no more, once like I did before.I can’t be good, baby,Honey, because the world’s gone wrong. I tried to be loving and treat you kind,But it seems like you never right, you got no loyal mind.I can’t be good no more, once like I did before.I can’t be good, baby,Honey, because the world’s gone wrong. If you have a woman and she don’t treat you kind,Praise the Good Lord to get her out of your mind.I can’t be good no more, once like I did before.I can’t be good, baby,Honey, because the world’s gone wrong. Said, when you been good now, can’t do no more,Just tell her kindly, “there is the front door.”I can’t be good no more, once like I did before.I can’t be good, baby,Honey, because the world’s gone wrong. Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,No use to ask me, baby, ‘cause I’ll never be back.I can’t be good no more, once like I did before.I can’t be good, baby,Honey, because the world’s gone wrong.

You’re a Big Girl NowOur conversation was short and sweetIt nearly swept me off-a my feet.And I’m back in the rain, oh, oh,And you are on dry land.You made it there somehowYou’re a big girl now.Bird on the horizon, sittin’ on a fence,He’s singin’ his song for me at his own expense.And I’m just like that bird, oh, oh,Singin’ just for you.I hope that you can hear,Hear me singin’ through these tears.Time is a jet plane, it moves too fastOh, but what a shame if all we’ve shared can’t last.I can change, I swear, oh, oh,See what you can do.I can make it through,You can make it too.Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,You’ve known it all the time, I’m learnin’ it these days.Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh,In somebody’s room.It’s a price I have to payYou’re a big girl all the way.A change in the weather is known to be extremeBut what’s the sense of changing horses in midstream?I’m going out of my mind, oh, oh,With a pain that stops and startsLike a corkscrew to my heartEver since we’ve been apart. You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You GoI’ve seen love go by my doorIt’s never been this close beforeNever been so easy or so slow.Been shooting in the dark too longWhen somethin’s not right it’s wrongYer gonna make me lonesome when you go.Dragon clouds so high aboveI’ve only known careless love,It’s always hit me from below.This time around it’s more correctRight on target, so direct,Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.Purple clover, Queen Anne lace,Crimson hair across your face,You could make me cry if you don’t know.Can’t remember what I was thinkin’ ofYou might be spoilin’ me too much, love,Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.Flowers on the hillside, bloomin’ crazy,Crickets talkin’ back and forth in rhyme,Blue river runnin’ slow and lazy,I could stay with you foreverAnd never realize the time.Situations have ended sad,Relationships have all been bad.Mine’ve been like Verlaine’s and Rimbaud.But there’s no way I can compareAll those scenes to this affair,Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.Yer gonna make me wonder what I’m doin’,Stayin’ far behind without you.Yer gonna make me wonder what I’m sayin’,Yer gonna make me give myself a good talkin’ to.I’ll look for you in old Honolulu,San Francisco, Ashtabula,Yer gonna have to leave me now, I know.But I’ll see you in the sky above,In the tall grass, in the ones I love,Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go You’re Gonna Quit Me, by Bob Dylan (arr)You’re gonna quit me, baby,Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd.Good as I been to you, Lawd, Lawd.Good as I been to you.Give you my money, honey,Buy you shoes and clothes, Lawd, Lawd.You’re gonna quit me, baby,Put me outta doors, Lawd, Lawd.Six months on the chain gang,Believe me, it ain’t no fun, Lawd, Lawd.Day you quit me, baby,That’s the day you die, Lawd, Lawd.Jailhouse ain’t no plaything,Believe me, ain’t no lie, Lawd, Lawd.Day you quit me, baby,That’s the day you die, Lawd, Lawd.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[工作流：用计算机技术实现业务过程的自动化，根据我们预先定义的规则解决多个参与者协同完成业务流程的技术。activiti目录结构bin下没有文件，database下有三个子文件夹create、drop、upgrade，里面存放不同的是脚本文件。其中upgrade是activiti由低版本升级高版本所对应的sql脚本。docs里面存放的是api等文件。activiti工作流5.13是依赖数据库（23张）来支持，使用mybatis操作数据库。他的前身是JBPM使用hibernate来操作数据库。BPMN2.0我们用来定义流程的文件名后缀。使用工作流第一步：根据create下的sql脚本创建数据库表（建议）、还可以使用api建表所有的表都是由act开头，第二部分表示表的用途标识，其用途也和对应的API相同.re*: ‘re’代表repository，包含流程定义和流程静态资源（图片，规则等）ru:‘runtime’,包含流程实例、任务、变量、异步任务等运行时的数据。Aciviti只在流程实例执行过程时保存这些数据，当流程结束后就会删除这些数据。id_:‘identity’,包含用户身份信息，用户和组等。hi*:‘history’,包含历史数据，比如历史流程实例、变量、任务。ge*:‘generation’:通用数据，用在不同的场景下。 使用API1、设计流程定义BPMN22、部署流程定义，保存到数据库getRepositoryService两种方式：加载单个流程定义文件、加载压缩的zip流程定义文件3、创建流程实例，getRuntimeService4、查看个人任务、办理个人任务getTaskService5、设置流程变量（4种方式）开启流程时设置流程变量startProcessInstanceByKey(“pylc”, variables);办理任务时设置流程变量processEngine.getTaskService().complete(taskid, variables);RuntimeService的set方法processEngine.getRuntimeService().setVariables(executionid, variables);TaskService的set方法processEngine.getTaskService().setVariables(taskid, variables);注意：设置自定义对象，应实现Serializable接口6、获取流程变量（3种方式）RuntimeService的get方法TaskService的get方法使用框架提供的表单式获取，例如${activeUser} 组任务多个参与者都可以构成一个组，这个组对应的是角色，组里的每个成员都可以拾取组任务，变成个人任务。 业务主键businesskey在启动流程时设置，通常是业务表的主键，当在办理任务时，可以通过业务主键来关联业务表，获取业务信息。 排他网关流程走到某一步时，出现分支，通过我们设置的流程变量，在流程定义中在每个分支上的设置条件来判断流程该往哪一步执行，只能执行其中一条分支。 删除历史流程实例当一个流程结束后，我们如果想让这个流程再重新启动一次，就要删除该流程的历史流程实例。根据processInstanceId通过historyservice的deleteProcessInstance方法删除。]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[HSSF is the POI Project’s pure Java implementation of the Excel ‘97(-2007) file format. XSSF is the POI Project’s pure Java implementation of the Excel 2007 OOXML (.xlsx) file format. HSSF and XSSF provides ways to read spreadsheets create, modify, read and write XLS spreadsheets.

try { secretBytes = MessageDigest.getInstance("md5").digest( plainText.getBytes()); } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) { throw new RuntimeException("没有md5这个算法！"); } String md5code = new BigInteger(1, secretBytes).toString(16);// 16进制数字 // 如果生成数字未满32位，需要前面补0 for (int i = 0;

//创建ztree $.fn.zTree.init( $("#ztree1"), setting, zNodes ); }); 第二种方式：使用简单json数组数据构成ztree(推荐)在实际开发中我们的节点数据一般来自于系统的业务数据,可以发送ajax请求找action要数据，然后赋给treeNodes &ltul id="ztree2" class="ztree"&gt&lt/ul&gt $(function(){ //当页面加载完成后动态创建菜单 var setting = { data: { simpleData: { enable: true,//启用简单数组数据 idKey: "id", pIdKey: "pId", rootPId: 0 } } }; var treeNodes = [ {"id":1, "pId":0, "name":"test1"}, {"id":11, "pId":1, "name":"test11"}, {"id":12, "pId":1, "name":"test12"}, {"id":111, "pId":11, "name":"test111"} ]; //创建ztree $.fn.zTree.init( $("#ztree2"), setting, treeNodes ); }); 给ztree绑定点击事件 function zTreeOnClick(event, treeId, treeNode) { var page=treeNode.page; if(page!=undefined){//需要打开选项卡 //判断当前选项卡是否已经打开 var isExists= $("#tt").tabs("exists",treeNode.name); if(isExists){ $("#tt").tabs("select",treeNode.name); }else{ $("#tt").tabs("add", { title: treeNode.name, content: '&ltiframe src="'+page+'" width="100%" frameborder="0" height="100%"&gt&lt/iframe&gt', closable: true, iconCls: 'icon-search' } ); } } }; var setting = { callback: { onClick: zTreeOnClick } }; jQuery EasyUI消息提示控件默认的提示框上面的按钮显示为ok，要想显示为中文，需要引入easyui下面locale下面的easyui-lang-zh_CN.js alert方法,消息提示框$.messager.alert(“标题”,”内容信息”,”question/error/info/warning”); show方法,页面右下角出来提示信息window.setTimeout(function(){ $.messager.show({ title:&apos;欢迎信息&apos;, msg:&apos;欢迎张三登录系统&apos;, timeout:3000, showType:&apos;slide&apos; }); }, 3000); confirm方法,确认框,如果点击确定，r的值为true$.messager.confirm(&quot;提示信息&quot;,&quot;你确定删除当前数据吗？&quot;,function(r){ alert(r); }); prompt方法，跟confirm的作用差不多$.messager.prompt(&quot;提示信息&quot;,&quot;你确定删除当前数据吗？&quot;,function(r){ alert(r);

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;三界：全军首个训练基地 、朱日和：科技含量最高、确山：唯一特种作战训练场。确山曾经去过两次，规模宏达，很征服人心。所以对三界和朱日和这两大军事训练基地充满了无限的向往。&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;朱日和训练基地势必是今年最吸引外界目光的军事训练场地。从6月份到9月份，连续举行了三场声势浩大的实兵演习。最先是持续两个月、用兵数万人的“跨越-2014·朱日和”实兵对抗系列演习，然后是8月末“和平使命—2014”上海合作组织成员国武装力量联合反恐实兵演习，最近的是首次信息化条件下实兵对抗卫勤保障演习“卫勤使命—2014”。 朱日和训练基地隶属北京军区，距离北京数百公里，位于内蒙古草原的锡林郭勒盟。其前身是某装甲兵训练场。据《解放军报》报道，1999年7月，为适应未来高技术战争的需要，中央军委决定将该训练场扩编成全军规模最大、科技含量最高、现代化程度最高的合同战术训练基地。2011年军委、总部决定将朱日和训练基地建成全军唯一陆军联合作战实验场。国防部网站的一篇文章将朱日和基地描绘为“全亚洲最大、解放军最先进的训练基地，也被称为‘中国欧文堡’”。朱日和训练基地由沙漠、草原、山地、壕沟等组成，占地1,066平方公里，与香港面积差不多。&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7月15日起，代号为“跨越-2016·朱日和”的陆军跨战区实兵检验性对抗演习，在位于内蒙古的朱日和训练基地展开。来自5个战区陆军的5支陆军合成旅将参加今年的演习，7月至9月底，他们会与我军首支陆军专业化模拟蓝军部队展开实兵对抗。&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7月19日，红军坦克在对坚固目标实施打击。当日，“跨越－2016·朱日和Ａ”演习开始进入实兵对抗阵地进攻战。“朱日和”系列演习是我军年度性的重大演习，对于检验战备状况，研究未来战争模式，解放军军改方向等都指导意义，堪称“年度大考”。据报道，今年的演习将改为“蓝军”进攻， “红军”防守的新模式。&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;看得出，这是一处绝佳的战场。的确，整整800年前，成吉思汗的铁骑由此扬鞭远征，横扫亚欧；300多年前，康熙皇帝御驾亲征，经此征讨准噶尔叛军。如今，这片广袤的古战场崛起为一座现代化的军事训练基地。]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Tomcat内存溢出的原因 在生产环境中tomcat内存设置不好很容易出现内存溢出。造成内存溢出是不一样的，当然处理方式也不一样。 这里根据平时遇到的情况和相关资料进行一个总结。常见的一般会有下面三种情况： 1.OutOfMemoryError： Java heap space 2.OutOfMemoryError： PermGen space 3.OutOfMemoryError： unable to create new native thread. Tomcat内存溢出解决方案 对于前两种情况，在应用本身没有内存泄露的情况下可以用设置tomcat jvm参数来解决。（-Xms -Xmx -XX：PermSize -XX：MaxPermSize） 最后一种可能需要调整操作系统和tomcat jvm参数同时调整才能达到目的。 第一种：是堆溢出。 原因分析：JVM堆的设置是指java程序运行过程中JVM可以调配使用的内存空间的设置.JVM在启动的时候会自动设置Heap size的值，其初始空间(即-Xms)是物理内存的1/64，最大空间(-Xmx)是物理内存的1/4。可以利用JVM提供的-Xmn -Xms -Xmx等选项可进行设置。Heap size 的大小是Young Generation 和Tenured Generaion 之和。在JVM中如果98％的时间是用于GC且可用的Heap size 不足2％的时候将抛出此异常信息。Heap Size 最大不要超过可用物理内存的80％，一般的要将-Xms和-Xmx选项设置为相同，而-Xmn为1/4的-Xmx值。 没有内存泄露的情况下，调整-Xms -Xmx参数可以解决。 -Xms：初始堆大小 -Xmx：最大堆大小 但堆的大小受下面三方面影响： 1.相关操作系统的数据模型（32-bt还是64-bit）限制；（32位系统下，一般限制在1.5G~2G；我在2003 server 系统下（物理内存：4G和6G，jdk：1.6）测试 1612M，64位操作系统对内存无限制。） 2.系统的可用虚拟内存限制； 3.系统的可用物理内存限制。 堆的大小可以使用 java -Xmx*M version 命令来测试。支持的话会出现jdk的版本号，不支持会报错。 -Xms -Xmx一般配置成一样比较好比如set JAVA_OPTS= -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m其初始空间(即-Xms)是物理内存的1/64，最大空间(-Xmx)是物理内存的1/4。可以利用JVM提供的-Xmn -Xms -Xmx等选项可进行设置实例，以下给出1G内存环境下java jvm 的参数设置参考：JAVA_OPTS=”-server -Xms800m -Xmx800m -XX:PermSize=64M -XX:MaxNewSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m -Djava.awt.headless=true “JAVA_OPTS=”-server -Xms768m -Xmx768m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -XX:NewSize=192m -XX:MaxNewSize=384m”CATALINA_OPTS=”-server -Xms768m -Xmx768m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m-XX:NewSize=192m -XX:MaxNewSize=384m”服务器为1G内存：JAVA_OPTS=”-server -Xms800m -Xmx800m -XX:PermSize=64M -XX:MaxNewSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m -Djava.awt.headless=true “服务器为64位、2G内存: JAVA_OPTS=’-server -Xms1024m -Xmx1536m -XX:PermSize=128M -XX:MaxNewSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m’——————-解决方案1：—————————–前提：是执行startup.bat启动tomcat的方式Linux服务器：在/usr/local/apache-tomcat-5.5.23/bin 目录下的catalina.sh添加：JAVA_OPTS=’-Xms512m -Xmx1024m’或者 JAVA_OPTS=”-server -Xms800m -Xmx800m -XX:MaxNewSize=256m”或者 CATALINA_OPTS=”-server -Xms256m -Xmx300m”Windows服务器：在catalina.bat最前面加入set JAVA_OPTS=-Xms128m -Xmx350m或者set CATALINA_OPTS=-Xmx300M -Xms256M（区别是一个直接设置jvm内存，另一个设置tomcat内存，CATALINA_OPTS似乎可以与JAVA_OPTS不加区别的使用）基本参数说明-client，-server这两个参数用于设置虚拟机使用何种运行模式，一定要作为第一个参数，client模式启动比较快，但运行时性能和内存管理效率不如server模式，通常用于客户端应用程序。相反，server模式启动比client慢，但可获得更高的运行性能。在windows上，缺省的虚拟机类型为client模式，如果要使用server模式，就需要在启动虚拟机时加-server参数，以获得更高性能，对服务器端应用，推荐采用server模式，尤其是多个CPU的系统。在Linux，Solaris上缺省采用server模式。此外，在多cup下，建议用server模式-Xms设置虚拟机可用内存堆的初始大小，缺省单位为字节，该大小为1024的整数倍并且要大于1MB，可用k(K)或m(M)为单位来设置较大的内存数。初始堆大小为2MB。加“m”说明是MB，否则就是KB了。例如：-Xms6400K，-Xms256M-Xmx设置虚拟机的最大可用大小，缺省单位为字节。该值必须为1024整数倍，并且要大于2MB。可用k(K)或m(M)为单位来设置较大的内存数。缺省堆最大值为64MB。例如：-Xmx81920K，-Xmx80M当应用程序申请了大内存运行时虚拟机抛出java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space错误，就需要使用-Xmx设置较大的可用内存堆。PermSize/MaxPermSize：定义Perm段的尺寸，即永久保存区域的大小，PermSize为JVM启动时初始化Perm的内存大小；MaxPermSize为最大可占用的Perm内存大小。在用户生产环境上一般将这两个值设为相同，以减少运行期间系统在内存申请上所花的开销。如果用startup.bat启动tomcat,OK设置生效.够成功的分配200M内存.——————-解决方案2：————————前提：是执行startup.bat启动tomcat的方式手动设置Heap sizeWindows服务器：修改TOMCAT_HOME/bin/catalina.bat，在“echo “Using CATALINA_BASE: $CATALINA_BASE””上面加入以下行：Java代码set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -server -Xms800m -Xmx800m -XX:MaxNewSize=256m注：JAVA_OPTS是保留先前设置。Linux服务器：修改TOMCAT_HOME/bin/catalina.sh在“echo “Using CATALINA_BASE: $CATALINA_BASE””上面加入以下行：JAVA_OPTS=”$JAVA_OPTS -server -Xms800m -Xmx800m -XX:MaxNewSize=256m”注：$JAVA_OPTS是保留先前设置。——————-解决方案3：—————————–前提：是执行windows的系统服务启动tomcat的方式但是如果不是执行startup.bat启动tomcat而是利用windows的系统服务启动tomcat服务,上面的设置就不生效了,就是说set JAVA_OPTS=-Xms128m -Xmx350m 没起作用.上面分配200M内存就OOM了..windows服务执行的是bin\tomcat.exe.他读取注册表中的值,而不是catalina.bat的设置.解决办法:修改注册表HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat Service Manager\Tomcat5\Parameters\JavaOptions原值为-Dcatalina.home=”C:\ApacheGroup\Tomcat 5.0”-Djava.endorsed.dirs=”C:\ApacheGroup\Tomcat 5.0\common\endorsed”-Xrs加入 -Xms300m -Xmx350m重起tomcat服务,设置生效——————-解决方案4：—————————–前提：是执行windows的系统服务启动tomcat的方式在安装tomcat时若有勾选”NT Service(NT/2000/XP only)”则安装完成后在安装目录的”bin”目录里会有一个tomcat.exe的档案先把tomcat的服务停掉在命令列模式下（运行里输入CMD）将目录切换到tomcat的bin目录用下面的命令把服务移除 tomcat -uninstall “Apache Tomcat 4.1” 接下来，写个批处理。内容如下set SERVICENAME=Apache Tomcat 4.1set CATALINA_HOME=E:\Tomcat 4.1.24set CLASSPATH=D:\j2sdk1.4.1_01\libset JAVACLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%set JAVACLASSPATH=%JAVACLASSPATH%;�TALINA_HOME%\bin\bootstrap.jarset JAVACLASSPATH=%JAVACLASSPATH%;�TALINA_HOME%\common\lib\servlet.jarset JAVACLASSPATH=%JAVACLASSPATH%;%JAVA_HOME%\lib\tools.jartomcat.exe -install “%SERVICENAME%” “%JAVA_HOME%\jre\bin\server\jvm.dll” -Djava.class.path=”%JAVACLASSPATH%” -Dcatalina.home=”�TALINA_HOME%” -Xms512m -Xmx768m -start org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap -params start -stop org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap -params stop -out “�TALINA_HOME%\logs\stdout.log” -err “�TALINA_HOME%\logs\stderr.log” 注意，从 tomcat.exe -install开始的是最后一行！不要手工回车换行把这一行分成了好几段。保存后在命令行下执行这个bat文件，注意执行的时候将“服务”窗口关闭。第二种：永久保存区域溢出 原因分析：PermGen space的全称是Permanent Generation space,是指内存的永久保存区域，这块内存主要是被JVM存放Class和Meta信息的,Class在被Loader时就会被放到PermGen space中，它和存放类实例(Instance)的Heap区域不同,GC(Garbage Collection)不会在主程序运行期对PermGen space进行清理，所以如果你的应用中有很CLASS的话,就很可能出现PermGen space错误，这种错误常见在web服务器对JSP进行pre compile的时候。如果你的WEB APP下都用了大量的第三方jar, 其大小超过了jvm默认的大小(4M)那么就会产生此错误信息了。但目前的hibernate和spring项目中也很容易出现这样的问题。可能是由于这些框架会动态class，而且jvm的gc是不会清理PemGen space的，超过了jvm默认的大小(4M)，导致内存溢出。 建议：将相同的第三方jar文件移置到tomcat/shared/lib目录下，这样可以达到减少jar 文档重复占用内存的目的。这一个一般是加大-XX：PermSize -XX：MaxPermSize 来解决问题。 -XX：PermSize 永久保存区域初始大小 -XX：PermSize 永久保存区域初始最大值 这一般结合第一条使用，比如 set JAVA_OPTS= -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -XX：PermSize=128M -XX：PermSize=256M 有一点需要注意：java -Xmx*M version 命令来测试的最大堆内存是 -Xmx与 -XX：PermSize的和比如系统支持最大的jvm堆大小事1.5G，那 -Xmx1024m -XX：PermSize=768M 是无法运行的。—————–解决方案1：————————-Linux服务器：在catalina.sh的第一行增加：JAVA_OPTS=-Xms64m-Xmx256m-XX:PermSize=128M-XX:MaxNewSize=256m-XX:MaxPermSize=256m或者在“echo “Using CATALINA_BASE: $CATALINA_BASE””上面加入以下行：JAVA_OPTS=”-server -XX:PermSize=64M -XX:MaxPermSize=128mWindows服务器：在catalina.bat的第一行增加：set JAVA_OPTS=-Xms64m -Xmx256m -XX:PermSize=128M -XX:MaxNewSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m—————–解决方案2：————————修改TOMCAT_HOME/bin/catalina.bat（Linux下为catalina.sh），在Java代码“echo “Using CATALINA_BASE: $CATALINA_BASE””上面加入以下行：set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -server -XX:PermSize=128M -XX:MaxPermSize=512m“echo “Using CATALINA_BASE: $CATALINA_BASE””上面加入以下行：set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -server -XX:PermSize=128M -XX:MaxPermSize=512mcatalina.sh下为：Java代码JAVA_OPTS=”$JAVA_OPTS -server -XX:PermSize=128M -XX:MaxPermSize=512m”JAVA_OPTS=”$JAVA_OPTS -server -XX:PermSize=128M -XX:MaxPermSize=512m” 第三种：无法创建新的线程。 这种现象比较少见，也比较奇怪，主要是和jvm与系统内存的比例有关。 这种怪事是因为JVM已经被系统分配了大量的内存（比如1.5G），并且它至少要占用可用内存的一半。有人发现，在线程个数很多的情况下，你分配给JVM的内存越多，那么，上述错误发生的可能性就越大。 原因分析（从这个blog中了解到原因：http://hi.baidu.com/hexiong/blog/item/16dc9e518fb10c2542a75b3c.html）： 每一个32位的进程最多可以使用2G的可用内存，因为另外2G被操作系统保留。这里假设使用1.5G给JVM，那么还余下500M可用内存。这500M内存中的一部分必须用于系统dll的加载，那么真正剩下的也许只有400M，现在关键的地方出现了：当你使用Java创建一个线程，在JVM的内存里也会创建一个Thread对象，但是同时也会在操作系统里创建一个真正的物理线程（参考JVM规范），操作系统会在余下的 400兆内存里创建这个物理线程，而不是在JVM的1500M的内存堆里创建。在jdk1.4里头，默认的栈大小是256KB，但是在jdk1.5里头，默认的栈大小为1M每线程，因此，在余下400M的可用内存里边我们最多也只能创建400个可用线程。 这样结论就出来了，要想创建更多的线程，你必须减少分配给JVM的最大内存。还有一种做法是让JVM宿主在你的JNI代码里边。 给出一个有关能够创建线程的最大个数的估算公式： （MaxProcessMemory - JVMMemory - ReservedOsMemory） / （ThreadStackSize）= Number of threads 对于jdk1.5而言，假设操作系统保留120M内存： 1.5GB JVM：（2GB-1.5Gb-120MB）/（1MB） = ~380 threads 1.0GB JVM：（2GB-1.0Gb-120MB）/（1MB） = ~880 threads 在2000/XP/2003的boot.ini里头有一个启动选项，好像是：/PAE /3G ，可以让用户进程最大内存扩充至3G，这时操作系统只能占用最多1G的虚存。那样应该可以让JVM创建更多的线程。 因此这种情况需要结合操作系统进行相关调整。 因此：我们需要结合不同情况对tomcat内存分配进行不同的诊断才能从根本上解决问题。 检测当前JVM内存使用情况：System.out.println(“JVM MAX MEMORY: “ + Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory()/1024/1024+”M”);System.out.println(“JVM IS USING MEMORY:” + Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory()/1024/1024+”M”);System.out.println(“JVM IS FREE MEMORY:” + Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory()/1024/1024+”M”);这三个方法都是说JVM的内存使用情况而不是操作系统的内存； maxMemory()这个方法返回的是java虚拟机（这个进程）能构从操作系统那里挖到的最大的内存，以字节为单位，如果在运行java程序的时候，没有添加-Xmx参数，那么就是64兆，也就是说maxMemory()返回的大约是6410241024字节，这是java虚拟机默认情况下能从操作系统那里挖到的最大的内存。如果添加了-Xmx参数，将以这个参数后面的值为准，例如java -cp ClassPath -Xmx512m ClassName，那么最大内存就是51210240124字节。 totalMemory()这个方法返回的是java虚拟机现在已经从操作系统那里挖过来的内存大小，也就是java虚拟机这个进程当时所占用的所有内存。如果在运行java的时候没有添加-Xms参数，那么，在java程序运行的过程的，内存总是慢慢的从操作系统那里挖的，基本上是用多少挖多少，直挖到maxMemory()为止，所以totalMemory()是慢慢增大的。如果用了-Xms参数，程序在启动的时候就会无条件的从操作系统中挖-Xms后面定义的内存数，然后在这些内存用的差不多的时候，再去挖。 freeMemory()是什么呢，刚才讲到如果在运行java的时候没有添加-Xms参数，那么，在java程序运行的过程的，内存总是慢慢的从操作系统那里挖的，基本上是用多少挖多少，但是java虚拟机100％的情况下是会稍微多挖一点的，这些挖过来而又没有用上的内存，实际上就是freeMemory()，所以freeMemory()的值一般情况下都是很小的，但是如果你在运行java程序的时候使用了-Xms，这个时候因为程序在启动的时候就会无条件的从操作系统中挖-Xms后面定义的内存数，这个时候，挖过来的内存可能大部分没用上，所以这个时候freeMemory()可能会有些——————–解决方案————————–JVM堆大小的调整 Sun HotSpot 1.4.1使用分代收集器，它把堆分为三个主要的域：新域、旧域以及永久域。Jvm生成的所有新对象放在新域中。一旦对象经历了一定数量的垃圾收集循环后，便获得使用期并进入旧域。在永久域中jvm则存储class和method对象。就配置而言，永久域是一个独立域并且不认为是堆的一部分。 下面介绍如何控制这些域的大小。可使用-Xms和-Xmx 控制整个堆的原始大小或最大值。 下面的命令是把初始大小设置为128M： java –Xms128m –Xmx256m为控制新域的大小，可使用-XX:NewRatio设置新域在堆中所占的比例。 下面的命令把整个堆设置成128m，新域比率设置成3，即新域与旧域比例为1：3，新域为堆的1/4或32M：java –Xms128m –Xmx128m–XX:NewRatio =3可使用-XX:NewSize和-XX:MaxNewsize设置新域的初始值和最大值。 下面的命令把新域的初始值和最大值设置成64m:java –Xms256m –Xmx256m –Xmn64m 永久域默认大小为4m。运行程序时，jvm会调整永久域的大小以满足需要。每次调整时，jvm会对堆进行一次完全的垃圾收集。 使用-XX:MaxPerSize标志来增加永久域搭大小。在WebLogic Server应用程序加载较多类时，经常需要增加永久域的最大值。当jvm加载类时，永久域中的对象急剧增加，从而使jvm不断调整永久域大小。为了避免调整，可使用-XX:PerSize标志设置初始值。 下面把永久域初始值设置成32m，最大值设置成64m。java -Xms512m -Xmx512m -Xmn128m -XX:PermSize=32m -XX:MaxPermSize=64m 默认状态下，HotSpot在新域中使用复制收集器。该域一般分为三个部分。第一部分为Eden，用于生成新的对象。另两部分称为救助空间，当Eden充满时，收集器停止应用程序，把所有可到达对象复制到当前的from救助空间，一旦当前的from救助空间充满，收集器则把可到达对象复制到当前的to救助空间。From和to救助空间互换角色。维持活动的对象将在救助空间不断复制，直到它们获得使用期并转入旧域。使用-XX:SurvivorRatio可控制新域子空间的大小。 同NewRation一样，SurvivorRation规定某救助域与Eden空间的比值。比如，以下命令把新域设置成64m，Eden占32m，每个救助域各占16m：java -Xms256m -Xmx256m -Xmn64m -XX:SurvivorRation =2 如前所述，默认状态下HotSpot对新域使用复制收集器，对旧域使用标记－清除－压缩收集器。在新域中使用复制收集器有很多意义，因为应用程序生成的大部分对象是短寿命的。理想状态下，所有过渡对象在移出Eden空间时将被收集。如果能够这样的话，并且移出Eden空间的对象是长寿命的，那么理论上可以立即把它们移进旧域，避免在救助空间反复复制。但是，应用程序不能适合这种理想状态，因为它们有一小部分中长寿命的对象。最好是保持这些中长寿命的对象并放在新域中，因为复制小部分的对象总比压缩旧域廉价。为控制新域中对象的复制，可用-XX:TargetSurvivorRatio控制救助空间的比例（该值是设置救助空间的使用比例。如救助空间位1M，该值50表示可用500K）。该值是一个百分比，默认值是50。当较大的堆栈使用较低的sruvivorratio时，应增加该值到80至90，以更好利用救助空间。用-XX:maxtenuring threshold可控制上限。 为放置所有的复制全部发生以及希望对象从eden扩展到旧域，可以把MaxTenuring Threshold设置成0。设置完成后，实际上就不再使用救助空间了，因此应把SurvivorRatio设成最大值以最大化Eden空间，设置如下：java … -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=0 –XX:SurvivorRatio＝50000 …垃圾回收描述：垃圾回收分多级，0级为全部(Full)的垃圾回收，会回收OLD段中的垃圾；1级或以上为部分垃圾回收，只会回收Young中的垃圾，内存溢出通常发生于OLD段或Perm段垃圾回收后，仍然无内存空间容纳新的Java对象的情况。当一个URL被访问时，内存申请过程如下：A. JVM会试图为相关Java对象在Eden中初始化一块内存区域B. 当Eden空间足够时，内存申请结束。否则到下一步C. JVM试图释放在Eden中所有不活跃的对象（这属于1或更高级的垃圾回收）；释放后若Eden空间仍然不足以放入新对象，则试图将部分Eden中活跃对象放入Survivor区/OLD区D. Survivor区被用来作为Eden及OLD的中间交换区域，当OLD区空间足够时，Survivor区的对象会被移到Old区，否则会被保留在Survivor区E. 当OLD区空间不够时，JVM会在OLD区进行完全的垃圾收集（0级）F. 完全垃圾收集后，若Survivor及OLD区仍然无法存放从Eden复制过来的部分对象，导致JVM无法在Eden区为新对象创建内存区域，则出现”out of memory错误”Java堆相关参数：ms/mx：定义YOUNG+OLD段的总尺寸，ms为JVM启动时YOUNG+OLD的内存大小；mx为最大可占用的YOUNG+OLD内存大小。在用户生产环境上一般将这两个值设为相同，以减少运行期间系统在内存申请上所花的开销。NewSize/MaxNewSize：定义YOUNG段的尺寸，NewSize为JVM启动时YOUNG的内存大小；MaxNewSize为最大可占用的YOUNG内存大小。在用户生产环境上一般将这两个值设为相同，以减少运行期间系统在内存申请上所花的开销。PermSize/MaxPermSize：定义Perm段的尺寸，PermSize为JVM启动时Perm的内存大小；MaxPermSize为最大可占用的Perm内存大小。在用户生产环境上一般将这两个值设为相同，以减少运行期间系统在内存申请上所花的开销。SurvivorRatio：设置Survivor空间和Eden空间的比例例：MEM_ARGS=”-Xms512m -Xmx512m -XX:NewSize=256m -XX:MaxNewSize=256m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m -XX:SurvivorRatio=6”在上面的例子中：YOUNG+OLD: 512MYOUNG: 256MPerm: 128MEden: YOUNG*6/(6+1+1)=192MSurvivor: YOUNG/(6+1+1)=32MJava堆的总尺寸=YOUNG+OLD+Perm=640M]]></content>
