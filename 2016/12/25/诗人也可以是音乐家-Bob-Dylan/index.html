        <p>10’000 men<br>Ten thousand men on a hill,<br>Ten thousand men on a hill,<br>Some of ‘m goin’ down, some of ‘m gonna get killed.<br>Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,<br>Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,<br>Drummin’ in the morning, in the evening they’ll be coming for you.<br>Ten thousand men on the move,<br>Ten thousand men on the move,<br>None of them doing nothin’ that your mama wouldn’t disapprove.<br>Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,<br>Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,<br>All clean shaven, all coming in from the cold.<br>Hey! Who could your lover be?<br>Hey! Who could your lover be?<br>Let me eat off his head so you can really see!<br>Ten thousand women all dressed in white,<br>Ten thousand women all dressed in white,<br>Standin’ at my window wishing me goodnight.<br>Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,<br>Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,<br>Each one of ‘em got seven wives, each one of ‘em just out of jail.<br>Ten thousand women all sweepin’ my room,<br>Ten thousand women all sweepin’ my room,<br>Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.<br>Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea!<br>Baby, thank you for my tea!<br>It’s so sweet of you to be so nice to me.</p>
<p>2x2<br>One by one, they followed the sun,<br>One by one, until there were none.<br>Two by two, to their lovers they flew,<br>Two by two, into the foggy dew.<br>Three by three, they danced on the sea,<br>Four by four, they danced on the shore,<br>Five by five, they tried to survive,<br>Six by six, they were playing with tricks.<br>Bridge #1:<br>How many paths did they try and fail?<br>How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?<br>How much poison did they inhale?<br>How many black cats crossed their trail?<br>Seven by seven, they headed for heaven,<br>Eight by eight, they got to the gate,<br>Nine by nine, they drank the wine,<br>Ten by ten, they drank again.<br>Bridge #2:<br>How many tomorrow’s have are they given away?<br>How many compared to yesterday?<br>How many more without any reward?<br>How many more can they afford?<br>Two by two, they stepped into the ark,<br>Two by two, they step in the dark.<br>Three by three, they’re turning the key,<br>Four by four, they turn it some more,<br>One by one, they follow the sun,<br>Two by two, to another rendezvous</p>
<p>4th Time Around<br>When she said,<br>“Don’t waste your words, they’re just lies,”<br>I cried she was deaf.<br>And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes,<br>Then said, “What else you got left?”<br>It was then that I got up to leave<br>But she said, “Don’t forget,<br>Everybody must give something back<br>For something they get.”</p>
<p>I stood there and hummed,<br>I tapped on her drum and asked her how come.<br>And she buttoned her boot,<br>And straightened her suit,<br>Then she said, “Don’t get cute.”<br>So I forced my hands in my pockets<br>And felt with my thumbs,<br>And gallantly handed her<br>My very last piece of gum.</p>
<p>She threw me outside,<br>I stood in the dirt where ev’ryone walked.<br>And after finding I’d<br>Forgotten my shirt,<br>I went back and knocked.<br>I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,<br>And I tried to make sense<br>Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair<br>That leaned up against . . .</p>
<p>Her Jamaican rum<br>And when she did come, I asked her for some.<br>She said, “No, dear.”<br>I said, “Your words aren’t clear,<br>You’d better spit out your gum.”<br>She screamed till her face got so red<br>Then she fell on the floor,<br>And I covered her up and then<br>Thought I’d go look through her drawer.</p>
<p>And, when I was through<br>I filled up my shoe<br>And brought it to you.<br>And you, you took me in,<br>You loved me then<br>You didn’t waste time.<br>And I, I never took much,<br>I never asked for your crutch.<br>Now don’t ask for mine.</p>
<p>A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall<br>Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?<br>Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?<br>I’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,<br>I’ve walked and I’ve crawled on six crooked highways,<br>I’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,<br>I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,<br>I’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,<br>And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard,<br>And it’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall.<br>Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?<br>Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?<br>I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it<br>I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,<br>I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin’,<br>I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin’,<br>I saw a white ladder all covered with water,<br>I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,<br>I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,<br>And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard,<br>And it’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall.<br>And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?<br>And what did you hear, my darling young one?<br>I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin’,<br>Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,<br>Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin’,<br>Heard ten thousand whisperin’ and nobody listenin’,<br>Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin’,<br>Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,<br>Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,<br>And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard,<br>And it’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall.<br>Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?<br>Who did you meet, my darling young one?<br>I met a young child beside a dead pony,<br>I met a white man who walked a black dog,<br>I met a young woman whose body was burning,<br>I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow,<br>I met one man who was wounded in love<br>I met another man who was wounded with hatred,<br>And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard,<br>It’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall.<br>Oh, what’ll you do now, my blue-eyed son?<br>Oh, what’ll you do now, my darling young one?<br>I’m a-goin’ back out ‘fore the rain starts a-fallin’,<br>I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest,<br>Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,<br>Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,<br>Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison,<br>Where the executioner’s face is always well hidden,<br>Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten,<br>Where black is the color, where none is the number,<br>And I’ll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it,<br>And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it,<br>Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin’,<br>But I’ll know my song well before I start singin’,<br>And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard,<br>It’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall.<br><a id="more"></a><br>Absolutely Sweet Marie<br>Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can’t jump it<br>Sometimes it gets so hard, you see<br>I’m just sitting here beating on my trumpet<br>With all these promises you left for me<br>But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?<br>Well, I waited for you when I was half sick<br>Yes, I waited for you when you hated me<br>Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic<br>When you knew I had some other place to be<br>Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?<br>Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously<br>But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately.<br>Well, six white horses that you did promise<br>Were fin’lly delivered down to the penitentiary<br>But to live outside the law, you must be honest<br>I know you always say that you agree<br>But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?<br>Well, I don’t know how it happened<br>But the river-boat captain, he knows my fate<br>But ev’rybody else, even yourself<br>They’re just gonna have to wait.<br>Well, I got the fever down in my pockets<br>The Persian drunkard, he follows me<br>Yes, I can take him to your house but I can’t unlock it<br>You see, you forgot to leave me with the key<br>Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?<br>Now, I been in jail when all my mail showed<br>That a man can’t give his address out to bad company<br>And now I stand here lookin’ at your yellow railroad<br>In the ruins of your balcony<br>Wond’ring where you are tonight, sweet Marie.</p>
<p>Abandoned Love<br>I can hear the turning of the key<br>I’ve been deceived by the clown inside of me.<br>I thought that he was righteous but he’s vain<br>Oh, something’s a-telling me I wear the ball and chain.<br>My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost<br>He’s always off somewhere when I need him most.<br>The Spanish moon is rising on the hill<br>But my heart is a-tellin’ me I love ya still.<br>I come back to the town from the flaming moon<br>I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon.<br>I love to see you dress before the mirror<br>Won’t you let me in your room one time ‘fore I finally disappear?<br>Everybody’s wearing a disguise<br>To hide what they’ve got left behind their eyes.<br>But me, I can’t cover what I am<br>Wherever the children go I’ll follow them.<br>I march in the parade of liberty<br>But as long as I love you I’m not free.<br>How long must I suffer such abuse<br>Won’t you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose?<br>I’ve given up the game, I’ve got to leave,<br>The pot of gold is only make-believe.<br>The treasure can’t be found by men who search<br>Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.<br>We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,<br>I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list.<br>My head tells me it’s time to make a change<br>But my heart is telling me I love ya but you’re strange.<br>One more time at midnight, near the wall<br>Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.<br>Won’t you descend from the throne, from where you sit?<br>Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.</p>
<p>Ain’t A-Gonna Grieve<br>Well, I ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more<br>Ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more<br>Ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more<br>And ain’t a-gonna grieve no more.<br>Come on brother, join the band,<br>Come on sisters, clap your hands,<br>Tell everybody that’s in the land,<br>You ain’t a-gonna grieve no more.<br>Well, I ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more<br>Ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more<br>Ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more<br>And ain’t a-gonna grieve no more.<br>Brown and blue and white and black,<br>All one color on the one-way track,<br>We got this far and ain’t a-goin’ back<br>And ain’t a-gonna grieve no more.<br>Well, I ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more<br>Ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more<br>Ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more<br>I ain’t a-gonna grieve no more.<br>We’re gonna notify your next of kin,<br>You’re gonna raise the roof until the house falls in.<br>If you get knocked down get up again,<br>We ain’t a-gonna grieve no more.<br>Well, I ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more<br>Ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more<br>Ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more<br>I ain’t a-gonna grieve no more.<br>We’ll sing this song all night long,<br>Sing it to my baby from midnight on.<br>She’ll sing it to you when I’m dead and gone,<br>Ain’t a-gonna grieve no more.<br>Well, I ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more<br>Ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more<br>Ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more<br>I ain’t a-gonna grieve no more.</p>

<p>Arthur McBride, by Bob Dylan (arr)<br>Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,<br>As we went a-walkin’ down by the seaside,<br>Mark now what followed and what did betide,<br>For it bein’ on Christmas mornin’<br>Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp,<br>And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp<br>And a little wee drummer intending to camp,<br>For the day bein’ pleasant and charmin’.</p>
<ol>
<li>“Good morning, good morning,” the Sergeant he cried.<br>“And the same to you, gentlemen,” we did reply,<br>Intending no harm but meant to pass by,<br>For it bein’ on Christmas mornin’<br>“But,” says he, “My fine fellows, if you will enlist,<br>Ten guineas in gold I’ll stick to your fist,<br>And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust,<br>And drink the king’s health in the morning.</li>
<li>“For a soldier, he leads a very fine life,<br>And he always is blessed with a charming young wife,<br>And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife,<br>And he always lives pleasant and charmin’,<br>And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,<br>In the finest of clothing he’s constantly seen.<br>While other poor fellows go dirty and mean,<br>And sup on thin gruel in the morning.”<br>Instrumental</li>
<li>“But,” says Arthur, “I wouldn’t be proud of your clothes,<br>For you’ve only the lend of them, as I suppose,<br>But you dare not change them one night, for you know<br>If you do, you’ll be flogged in the morning,<br>And although that we’re single and free,<br>We take great delight in our own company,<br>We have no desire strange places to see,<br>Although that your offers are charming.</li>
<li>“And we have no desire to take your advance,<br>All hazards and dangers we barter on chance,<br>For you’d have no scruples for to send us to France,<br>Where we would get shot without warning,”<br>“Oh no,” says the Sergeant. “I’ll have no such chat,<br>And neither will I take it from snappy young brats,<br>For if you insult me with one other word,<br>I’ll cut off your heads in the morning.”</li>
<li>And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,<br>And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades<br>When a trusty shillelagh came over their head<br>And bid them take that as fair warning.<br>And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,<br>We flung them as far as we could in the tide,<br>“Now take them up, devils!” cried Arthur McBride,<br>“And temper their edge in the mornin’!”</li>
<li>And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow,<br>And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,<br>Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll,<br>And bade it a tedious returning,<br>And we havin’ no money, paid them off in cracks.<br>We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,<br>And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks,<br>And left them for dead in the morning.</li>
<li>And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,<br>We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits,<br>For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts<br>And bid them look sharp in the mornin’.<br>Instrumental</li>
<li><p>Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,<br>As we went a-walkin’ down by the seaside,<br>Mark now what followed and what did betide,<br>For it bein’ on Christmas mornin’</p>
<p>As I Went Out One Morning<br>As I went out one morning<br>To breathe the air around Tom Paine’s,<br>I spied the fairest damsel<br>That ever did walk in chains.<br>I offer’d her my hand,<br>She took me by the arm.<br>I knew that very instant,<br>She meant to do me harm.<br>“Depart from me this moment,”<br>I told her with my voice.<br>Said she, “But I don’t wish to,”<br>Said I, “But you have no choice.”<br>“I beg you, sir,” she pleaded<br>From the corners of her mouth,<br>“I will secretly accept you<br>And together we’ll fly south.”<br>Just then Tom Paine, himself,<br>Came running from across the field,<br>Shouting at this lovely girl<br>And commanding her to yield.<br>And as she was letting go her grip,<br>Up Tom Paine did run,<br>“I’m sorry, sir,” he said to me,<br>“I’m sorry for what she’s done.”</p>

<p>Ballad in Plain D<br>I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze.<br>With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.<br>I courted her proudly but now she is gone,<br>Gone as the season she’s taken.<br>Through young summer’s breeze, I stole her away<br>From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.<br>Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,<br>With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.<br>Of the two sisters, I loved the young.<br>With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.<br>The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone<br>By the jealousy of others around her.<br>For her parasite sister, I had no respect,<br>Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect.<br>Countless visions of the other she’d reflect<br>As a crutch for her scenes and her society.<br>Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused,<br>The changes I was going through can’t even be used,<br>For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose<br>The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.<br>With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip<br>A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,<br>Noticing not that I’d already slipped<br>To a sin of love’s false security.<br>From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,<br>Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies,<br>Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, “Please,<br>What’s wrong and what’s exactly the matter?”<br>And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,<br>The timeless explosion of fantasy’s dream.<br>At the peak of the night, the king and the queen<br>Tumbled all down into pieces.<br>“The tragic figure!” her sister did shout,<br>“Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!”<br>And I in my armor, turning about<br>And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness.<br>Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound<br>Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.<br>And she in between, the victim of sound,<br>Soon shattered as a child ‘neath her shadows.<br>All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight.<br>I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight.<br>My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night<br>Leaving all of love’s ashes behind me.<br>The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet.<br>The words to say I’m sorry, I haven’t found yet.<br>I think of her often and hope whoever she’s met<br>Will be fully aware of how precious she is.<br>Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,<br>“How good, how good does it feel to be free?”<br>And I answer them most mysteriously,<br>“Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?”</p>

<p>Ballad Of Donald White<br>My name is Donald White, you see,<br>I stand before you all.<br>I was judged by you a murderer<br>And the hangman’s knot must fall.<br>I will die upon the gallows pole<br>When the moon is shining clear,<br>And these are my final words<br>That you will ever hear.<br>I left my home in Kansas<br>When I was very young,<br>I landed in the old Northwest,<br>Seattle, Washington<br>Although I’d a-traveled many miles,<br>I never made a friend,<br>For I could never get along in life<br>With people that I met.<br>If I had some education<br>To give me a decent start,<br>I might have been a doctor or<br>A master in the arts.<br>But I used my hands for stealing<br>When I was very young,<br>And they locked me down in jailhouse cells,<br>That’s how my life begun.<br>Oh, the inmates and the prisoners,<br>I found they were my kind,<br>And it was there inside the bars<br>I found my peace of mind.<br>But the jails they were too crowded,<br>Institutions overflowed,<br>So they turned me loose to walk upon<br>Life’s hurried tangled road.<br>And there’s danger on the ocean<br>Where the salt sea waves split high,<br>And there’s danger on the battlefield<br>Where the shells of bullets fly,<br>And there’s danger in this open world<br>Where men strive to be free,<br>And for me the greatest danger<br>Was in society.<br>So I asked them to send me back<br>To the institution home.<br>But they said they were too crowded,<br>For me they had no room.<br>I got down on my knees and begged,<br>“Oh, please put me away,”<br>But they would not listen to my plea<br>Or nothing I would say.<br>And so it was on Christmas eve<br>In the year of ‘59,<br>It was on that night I killed a man,<br>I did not try to hide,<br>The jury found me guilty<br>And I won’t disagree,<br>For I knew that it would happen<br>If I wasn’t put away.<br>And I’m glad I’ve had no parents<br>To care for me or cry,<br>For now they will never know<br>The horrible death I die.<br>And I’m also glad I’ve had no friends<br>To see me in disgrace,<br>For they’ll never see that hangman’s hood<br>Wrap around my face.<br>Farewell unto the old north woods<br>Of which I used to roam,<br>Farewell unto the crowded bars<br>Of which’ve been my home,<br>Farewell to all you people<br>Who think the worst of me,<br>I guess you’ll feel much better when<br>I’m on that hanging tree.<br>But there’s just one question<br>Before they kill me dead,<br>I’m wondering just how much<br>To you I really said<br>Concerning all the boys that come<br>Down a road like me,<br>Are they enemies or victims<br>Of your society?</p>

<p>Bob Dylan’s Dream<br>While riding on a train goin’ west,<br>I fell asleep for to take my rest.<br>I dreamed a dream that made me sad,<br>Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.<br>With half-damp eyes I stared to the room<br>Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,<br>Where we together weathered many a storm,<br>Laughin’ and singin’ till the early hours of the morn.<br>By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,<br>Our words were told, our songs were sung,<br>Where we longed for nothin’ and were quite satisfied<br>Talkin’ and a-jokin’ about the world outside.<br>With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,<br>We never thought we could ever get old.<br>We thought we could sit forever in fun<br>But our chances really was a million to one.<br>As easy it was to tell black from white,<br>It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.<br>And our choices were few and the thought never hit<br>That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.<br>How many a year has passed and gone,<br>And many a gamble has been lost and won,<br>And many a road taken by many a friend,<br>And each one I’ve never seen again.<br>I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,<br>That we could sit simply in that room again.<br>Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,<br>I’d give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.</p>
<p>Bob Dylan’s New Orleans Rag<br>I was sittin’ on a stump<br>Down in New Orleans,<br>I was feelin’ kinda low down,<br>Dirty and mean.<br>Along came a fella<br>And he didn’t even ask.<br>He says, “I know of a woman<br>That can fix you up fast.”<br>I didn’t think twice,<br>I said like I should,<br>“Let’s go find this lady<br>That can do me some good.”<br>We walked across the river<br>On a sailin’ spree<br>And we came to a door<br>Called one-oh-three.<br>I was just about ready<br>To give it a little knock<br>When out comes a fella<br>Who couldn’t even walk.<br>He’s linkin’ and a-slinkin’,<br>Couldn’t stand on his feet,<br>And he moaned and he groaned<br>And he shuffled down the street.<br>Well, out of the door<br>There comes another man.<br>He wiggled and he wobbled,<br>He couldn’t hardly stand.<br>He had this frightened<br>Look in his eyes,<br>Like he just fought a bear,<br>He was ready to die.<br>Well, I peeked through the key crack,<br>Comin’ down the hall<br>Was a long-legged man<br>Who couldn’t hardly crawl.<br>He muttered and he uttered<br>In broken French,<br>And he looked like he’d been through<br>A monkey wrench.<br>Well, by this time<br>I was a-scared to knock,<br>I was a-scared to move,<br>I’s in a state of shock.<br>I hummed a little tune<br>And I shuffled my feet<br>And I started walkin’ backwards<br>Down that broad street.<br>Well, I got to the corner,<br>I tried my best to smile.<br>I turned around the corner<br>And I ran a bloody mile.<br>Man, I wasn’t runnin’<br>‘Cause I was sick,<br>I was just a-runnin’<br>To get out of there quick.<br>Well, I tripped right along<br>And I’m a-wheezin’ in my chest.<br>I musta run a mile<br>In a minute or less.<br>I walked on a log<br>And I tripped on a stump,<br>I caught a fast freight<br>With a one-arm jump.<br>So, if you’re travelin’ down<br>Louisiana way,<br>And you feel kinda lonesome<br>And you need a place to stay,<br>Man, you’re better off<br>In your misery<br>Than to tackle that lady<br>At one-oh-three.</p>
<p>Boots of Spanish Leather<br>Oh, I’m sailin’ away my own true love,<br>I’m sailin’ away in the morning.<br>Is there something I can send you from across the sea,<br>From the place that I’ll be landing?<br>No, there’s nothin’ you can send me, my own true love,<br>There’s nothin’ I wish to be ownin’.<br>Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled,<br>From across that lonesome ocean.<br>Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine<br>Made of silver or of golden,<br>Either from the mountains of Madrid<br>Or from the coast of Barcelona.<br>Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night<br>And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,<br>I’d forsake them all for your sweet kiss,<br>For that’s all I’m wishin’ to be ownin’.<br>That I might be gone a long time<br>And it’s only that I’m askin’,<br>Is there something I can send you to remember me by,<br>To make your time more easy passin’.<br>Oh, how can, how can you ask me again,<br>It only brings me sorrow.<br>The same thing I want from you today,<br>I would want again tomorrow.<br>I got a letter on a lonesome day,<br>It was from her ship a-sailin’,<br>Saying I don’t know when I’ll be comin’ back again,<br>It depends on how I’m a-feelin’.<br>Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way,<br>I’m sure your mind is roamin’.<br>I’m sure your heart is not with me,<br>But with the country to where you’re goin’.<br>So take heed, take heed of the western wind,<br>Take heed of the stormy weather.<br>And yes, there’s something you can send back to me,<br>Spanish boots of Spanish leather.</p>
<p>Born in Time<br>In the lonely night<br>In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light<br>You’re comin’ thru to me in black and white<br>When we were made of dreams.<br>You’re blowing down the shaky street,<br>You’re hearing my heart beat<br>In the record breaking heat<br>Where we were born in time.<br>Bridge #1:<br>Not one more night, not one more kiss,<br>Not this time baby, no more of this,<br>Takes too much skill, takes too much will,<br>It’s revealing.<br>You came, you saw, just like the law<br>You married young, just like your ma,<br>You tried and tried, you made me slide<br>You left me reelin’ with this feelin’.<br>On the rising curve<br>Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,<br>You won’t get anything you don’t deserve<br>Where we were born in time.<br>Bridge #2:<br>You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,<br>You hang the flame, you’ll pay the price,<br>Oh babe, that fire<br>Is still smokin’.<br>You were snow, you were rain<br>You were striped, you were plain,<br>Oh babe, truer words<br>Have not been spoken or broken.<br>In the hills of mystery,<br>In the foggy web of destiny,<br>You can have what’s left of me,<br>Where we were born in time.</p>

<p>Brownsville Girl, by Bob Dylan and Sam Shepard<br>Well, there was this movie I seen one time,<br>About a man riding ‘cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.<br>He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.<br>The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.<br>Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp<br>as the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath.<br>Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square,<br>I want him to feel what it’s like to every moment face his death.<br>Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in<br>And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain.<br>You know I can’t believe we’ve lived so long and are still so far apart.<br>The memory of you keeps callin’ after me like a rollin’ train.<br>I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert<br>In your busted down Ford and your platform heels<br>I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet<br>Ah, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.<br>Well, we drove that car all night into San Anton’<br>And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft.<br>Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.<br>I would have gone on after you but I didn’t feel like letting my head get blown off.<br>Well, we’re drivin’ this car and the sun is comin’ up over the Rockies,<br>Now I know she ain’t you but she’s here and she’s got that dark rhythm in her soul.<br>But I’m too over the edge and I ain’t in the mood anymore to remember the times when I was your only man<br>And she don’t want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control.<br>Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br>Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love.<br>Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo<br>We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a wreckin’ lot outside of town about a mile.<br>Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back. She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.<br>She said, “Henry ain’t here but you can come on in, he’ll be back in a little while.”<br>Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin’ of bummin’ a ride back to where she started.<br>But ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up.<br>She said, “Welcome to the land of the living dead.” You could tell she was so broken-hearted.<br>She said, “Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt.”<br>“How far are y’all going?” Ruby asked us with a sigh.<br>“We’re going all the way ‘til the wheels fall off and burn,<br>‘Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies.”<br>Ruby just smiled and said, “Ah, you know some babies never learn.”<br>Something about that movie though, well I just can’t get it out of my head<br>But I can’t remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.<br>All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved<br>And a lot of them seemed to be lookin’ my way.<br>Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br>Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love.<br>Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour.<br>I was crossin’ the street when shots rang out.<br>I didn’t know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.<br>“We got him cornered in the churchyard,” I heard somebody shout.<br>Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it, it said, “A man with no alibi.”<br>You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.<br>Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,<br>It was the best acting I saw anybody do.<br>Now I’ve always been the kind of person that doesn’t like to trespass but sometimes you just find yourself over the line.<br>Oh if there’s an original thought out there, I could use it right now.<br>You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain’t sayin’ much. I could feel a whole lot better,<br>If you were just here by my side to show me how.<br>Well, I’m standin’ in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,<br>Yeah, but you know it’s not the one that I had in mind.<br>He’s got a new one out now, I don’t even know what it’s about<br>But I’ll see him in anything so I’ll stand in line.<br>Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br>Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love.<br>You know, it’s funny how things never turn out the way you had ‘em planned.<br>The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name wasn’t Henry Porter.<br>And you know there was somethin’ about you baby that I liked that was always too good for this world<br>Just like you always said there was something about me you liked that I left behind in the French Quarter.<br>Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content.<br>I don’t have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I’m gone.<br>You always said people don’t do what they believe in, they just do what’s most convenient, then they repent.<br>And I always said, “Hang on to me, baby, and let’s hope that the roof stays on.”<br>There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice.<br>I don’t remember who I was or where I was bound.<br>All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun and he was shot in the back.<br>Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.<br>Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br>Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love.</p>

<li>So she bargained with the sailor boy,<br>All for a piece of gold.<br>Straightaway then he led her<br>Down into the hold,<br>Sayin’, “I’ll dress you up in sailor’s clothes,<br>Your jacket shall be blue.<br>You’ll see that seaport town<br>Of Canadee-i-o.</li>
<li>Now, when the other sailors heard the news,<br>Well, they fell into a rage,<br>And with all the ship’s company<br>They were willing to engage.<br>Saying, “We’ll tie her hands and feet, my boys,<br>Overboard we’ll throw her.<br>She’ll never see that seaport town<br>Called Canadee-i-o.</li>
<li>Now, when the captain he heard the news,<br>Well, he too fell in a rage,<br>And with the whole ship’s company<br>He was willing to engage,<br>Sayin’, “She’ll stay in sailor’s clothes,<br>Her color shall be blue,<br>She’ll see that seaport town<br>Call Canadee-i-o.</li>
<li>Now, when they come down to Canada<br>Scarcely ‘bout half a year,<br>She’s married this bold captain<br>Who called her his dear.<br>She’s dressed in silks and satins now,<br>She cuts a gallant show,<br>Finest of the ladies<br>Down Canadee-i-o.</li>
<li>Come, all you fair and tender girls,<br>Wheresoever you may be,<br>I’d have you to follow your own true love<br>Whene’er he goes to sea.<br>For if the sailors prove false to you,<br>Well, the captain, he might prove true.<br>You’ll see the honor I have gained<br>By the wearing of the blue.</li>

I don’t know, I suppose.<br>She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes<br>But I kept hearing my name and I had to be movin’ on.<br>I saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin,<br>I saw a house in the country being torn from within.<br>I heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.<br>And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico<br>Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire<br>And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,<br>Bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire.</p>

<p>Changing of the Guards<br>Sixteen years,<br>Sixteen banners united over the field<br>Where the good shepherd grieves.<br>Desperate men, desperate women divided,<br>Spreading their wings ‘neath the falling leaves.<br>Fortune calls.<br>I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace,<br>Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down.<br>She’s smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born,<br>On midsummer’s eve, near the tower.<br>The cold-blooded moon.<br>The captain waits above the celebration<br>Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid<br>Whose ebony face is beyond communication.<br>The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.<br>They shaved her head.<br>She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo.<br>A messenger arrived with a black nightingale.<br>I seen her on the stairs and I couldn’t help but follow,<br>Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.<br>I stumbled to my feet.<br>I rode past destruction in the ditches<br>With the stitches still mending ‘neath a heart-shaped tattoo.<br>Renegade priests and treacherous young witches<br>Were handing out the flowers that I’d given to you.<br>The palace of mirrors<br>Where dog soldiers are reflected,<br>The endless road and the wailing of chimes,<br>The empty rooms where her memory is protected,<br>Where the angels’ voices whisper to the souls of previous times.<br>She wakes him up<br>Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking<br>Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks.<br>She’s begging to know what measures he now will be taking.<br>He’s pulling her down and she’s clutching on to his long golden locks.<br>Gentlemen, he said,<br>I don’t need your organization, I’ve shined your shoes,<br>I’ve moved your mountains and marked your cards<br>But Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination<br>Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.<br>Peace will come<br>With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire<br>But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall<br>And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating<br>Between the King and the Queen of Swords.</p>

<p>Diamond Joe, by Bob Dylan (arr)<br>Now There’s a man you’ll hear about<br>Most anywhere you go,<br>And his holdings are in Texas<br>And his name is Diamond Joe.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>And he carries all his money<br>In a diamond-studded jar.<br>He never took much trouble<br>With the process of the law.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys,<br>Did offer him my hand,<br>He gave a string of horses<br>So old they could not stand.</p>
</li>
<li>And I nearly starved to death, boys,<br>He did mistreat me so,<br>And I never saved a dollar<br>In the pay of Diamond Joe.</li>
<li>Now his bread it was corn dodger<br>And his meat you couldn’t chaw,<br>Nearly drove me crazy<br>With the waggin’ of his jaw.</li>
<li>And the tellin’ of his story,<br>Mean to let you know<br>That there never was a rounder<br>That could lie like Diamond Joe.<br>Instrumental</li>
<li>Now, I tried three times to quit him,<br>But he did argue so<br>I’m still punchin’ cattle<br>In the pay of Diamond Joe.</li>
<li>And when I’m called up yonder<br>And it’s my time to go,<br>Give my blankets to my buddies<br>Give the fleas to Diamond Joe</li>
</ol>
<p>Dirge<br>I hate myself for lovin’ you and the weakness that it showed<br>You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.<br>The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,<br>I hate myself for lovin’ you and I’m glad the curtain fell.<br>I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed<br>And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?<br>I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,<br>That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.</p>
<p>Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped,<br>Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped.<br>Like a slave in orbit, he’s beaten ‘til he’s tame,<br>All for a moment’s glory and it’s a dirty, rotten shame.</p>
<p>There are those who worship loneliness, I’m not one of them,<br>In this age of fiberglass I’m searching for a gem.<br>The crystal ball up on the wall hasn’t shown me nothing yet,<br>I’ve paid the price of solitude, but at last I’m out of debt.<br>Can’t recall a useful thing you ever did for me<br>‘Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees.<br>We stared into each other’s eyes ‘til one of us would break,<br>No use to apologize, what diff’rence would it make?<br>So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine,<br>The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.<br>Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I’m at,<br>I hate myself for lovin’ you, but I should get over that.</p>

<p>Every Grain of Sand<br>In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need<br>When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed<br>There’s a dyin’ voice within me reaching out somewhere,<br>Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.<br>Don’t have the inclination to look back on any mistake,<br>Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break.<br>In the fury of the moment I can see the Master’s hand<br>In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.<br>Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,<br>Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer.<br>The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way<br>To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.<br>I gaze into the doorway of temptation’s angry flame<br>And every time I pass that way I always hear my name.<br>Then onward in my journey I come to understand<br>That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.<br>I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night<br>In the violence of a summer’s dream, in the chill of a wintry light,<br>In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,<br>In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.<br>I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea<br>Sometimes I turn, there’s someone there, other times it’s only me.<br>I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man<br>Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.</p>

<p>Hard Times, by Bob Dylan (arr)</p>
<ol>
<li>Let us pause in life’s pleasures and count its many tears<br>While we all sup sorrow with the poor.<br>There’s a song that will linger forever in our ears,<br>Oh, hard times, come again no more.<br>‘Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.<br>Hard times, hard times, come again no more.<br>Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.<br>Oh, hard times, come again no more.</li>
<li>While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay.<br>There are frail forms fainting at the door.<br>Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say.<br>Oh, hard times, come again no more.<br>‘Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.<br>Hard times, hard times, come again no more.<br>Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.<br>Oh, hard times, come again no more.</li>

<p>Joey, by Bob Dylan and Jacques Levy<br>Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when<br>Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion<br>Always on the outside of whatever side there was<br>When they asked him why it had to be that way, “Well,” he answered, “just because.”<br>Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last.<br>They called Joe “Crazy,” the baby they called “Kid Blast.”<br>Some say they lived off gambling and runnin’ numbers too.<br>It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.<br>Joey, Joey,<br>King of the streets, child of clay.<br>Joey, Joey,<br>What made them want to come and blow you away?<br>There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that<br>No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.<br>When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof.<br>He went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin’ he was bulletproof.<br>The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets<br>Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats<br>Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners.<br>They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs.<br>The hostages were tremblin’ when they heard a man exclaim,<br>“Let’s blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame.”<br>But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, “We’re not those kind of men.<br>It’s peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again.”<br>Joey, Joey,<br>King of the streets, child of clay.<br>Joey, Joey,<br>What made them want to come and blow you away?<br>The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith<br>They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with.<br>“What time is it?” said the judge to Joey when they met<br>“Five to ten,” said Joey. The judge says, “That’s exactly what you get.”<br>He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich<br>They threw him in the hole one time for tryin’ to stop a strike.<br>His closest friends were black men ‘cause they seemed to understand<br>What it’s like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.</p>
<p>When they let him out in ‘71 he’d lost a little weight<br>But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.<br>He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind<br>To the boss he said, “I have returned and now I want what’s mine.”<br>Joey, Joey,<br>King of the streets, child of clay.<br>Joey, Joey,<br>Why did they have to come and blow you away?<br>It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun<br>“I’m around too many children,” he’d say, “they should never know of one.”<br>Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe,<br>Emptied out the register, said, “Tell ‘em it was Crazy Joe.”<br>One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York<br>He could see it comin’ through the door as he lifted up his fork.<br>He pushed the table over to protect his family<br>Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.<br>Joey, Joey,<br>King of the streets, child of clay.<br>Joey, Joey,<br>What made them want to come and blow you away?<br>Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep.<br>I heard his best friend Frankie say, “He ain’t dead, he’s just asleep.”<br>Then I saw the old man’s limousine head back towards the grave<br>I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.<br>The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned<br>They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.<br>And someday if God’s in heaven overlookin’ His preserve<br>I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.<br>Joey, Joey,<br>King of the streets, child of clay.<br>Joey, Joey,<br>What made them want to come and blow you away?</p>
<p>Jim Jones, by Bob Dylan (arr)<br>Come and listen for a moment, lads,<br>And hear me tell my tale.<br>How across the sea from England<br>I was condemned to sail.<br>Now the jury found me guilty,<br>Then says the judge, says he,<br>“Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I’m sending you<br>Across the stormy sea.<br>But take a tip before you ship<br>To join the iron gang.<br>Don’t get too gay in Botany Bay,<br>Or else you’ll surely hang.<br>Or else you’ll surely hang,” says he.<br>“And after that, Jim Jones,<br>It’s high above on the gallows tree<br>The crows will pick your bones.”</p>

<li>And our ship was high upon the sea<br>Then pirates came along,<br>But the soldiers on our convict ship<br>Were full five hundred strong.<br>For they opened fire and somehow drove<br>That pirate ship away.<br>But I’d rather have joined that pirate ship<br>Tan gone to Botany Bay.<br>With the storms ragin’ round us,<br>And the winds a-blowin’ gale,<br>I’d rather have drowned in misery<br>Than gone to New South Wales.</li>
<li>Now it’s day and night and the irons clang,<br>And like poor galley slaves<br>We toil and toil, and when we die<br>Must fill dishonored graves,<br>And it’s by and by I’ll slip my chains,<br>Well, into the bush I’ll go<br>And I’ll join the bravest rankers there,<br>Jack Donohue and co.<br>And some dark night, when everything<br>Is silent in the town<br>I’ll shoot those tyrants one and all,<br>I’ll gun the flogger down.<br>Oh, I’ll give the land a little shock,<br>Remember what I say,<br>And they’ll yet regret they’ve sent Jim Jones<br>In chains to Botany Bay.</li>

<p>John Brown<br>John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore.<br>His mama sure was proud of him!<br>He stood straight and tall in his uniform and all.<br>His mama’s face broke out all in a grin.<br>“Oh son, you look so fine, I’m glad you’re a son of mine,<br>You make me proud to know you hold a gun.<br>Do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get,<br>And we’ll put them on the wall when you come home.”<br>As that old train pulled out, John’s ma began to shout,<br>Tellin’ ev’ryone in the neighborhood:<br>“That’s my son that’s about to go, he’s a soldier now, you know.”<br>She made well sure her neighbors understood.<br>She got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smile<br>As she showed them to the people from next door.<br>And she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun,<br>And these things you called a good old-fashioned war.<br>Oh! Good old-fashioned war!<br>Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come.<br>They ceased to come for about ten months or more.<br>Then a letter finally came saying, “Go down and meet the train.<br>Your son’s a-coming home from the war.”<br>She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around<br>But she could not see her soldier son in sight.<br>But as all the people passed, she saw her son at last,<br>When she did she could hardly believe her eyes.<br>Oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off<br>And he wore a metal brace around his waist.<br>He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not know,<br>While she couldn’t even recognize his face!<br>Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face.<br>“Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they done.<br>How is it you come to be this way?”<br>He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move<br>And the mother had to turn her face away.<br>“Don’t  ou remember, Ma, when I went off to war<br>You thought it was the best thing I could do?<br>I was on the battleground, you were home . . . acting proud.<br>You wasn’t there standing in my shoes.”<br>“Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?<br>I’m a-tryin’ to kill somebody or die tryin’.<br>But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close<br>And I saw that his face looked just like mine.”<br>Oh! Lord! Just like mine!<br>“And I couldn’t help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink,<br>That I was just a puppet in a play.<br>And through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke,<br>And a cannon ball blew my eyes away.”<br>As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shock<br>At seein’ the metal brace that helped him stand.<br>But as he turned to go, he called his mother close<br>And he dropped his medals down into her hand</p>

<p>Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie<br>When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb<br>When you think you’re too old, too young, too smart or too dumb<br>When yer laggin’ behind an’ losin’ yer pace<br>In a slow-motion crawl of life’s busy race<br>No matter what yer doing if you start givin’ up<br>If the wine don’t come to the top of yer cup<br>If the wind’s got you sideways with with one hand holdin’ on<br>And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone<br>And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it<br>And the wood’s easy findin’ but yer lazy to fetch it<br>And yer sidewalk starts curlin’ and the street gets too long<br>And you start walkin’ backwards though you know its wrong<br>And lonesome comes up as down goes the day<br>And tomorrow’s mornin’ seems so far away<br>And you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin’<br>And yer rope is a-slidin’ ‘cause yer hands are a-drippin’<br>And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys<br>Turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys<br>And yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe’s a-pourin’<br>And the lightnin’s a-flashing and the thunder’s a-crashin’<br>And the windows are rattlin’ and breakin’ and the roof tops a-shakin’<br>And yer whole world’s a-slammin’ and bangin’<br>And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm<br>And to yourself you sometimes say<br>“I never knew it was gonna be this way<br>Why didn’t they tell me the day I was born”<br>And you start gettin’ chills and yer jumping from sweat<br>And you’re lookin’ for somethin’ you ain’t quite found yet<br>And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air<br>And the whole world’s a-watchin’ with a window peek stare<br>And yer good gal leaves and she’s long gone a-flying<br>And yer heart feels sick like fish when they’re fryin’<br>And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet<br>And you need it badly but it lays on the street<br>And yer bell’s bangin’ loudly but you can’t hear its beat<br>And you think yer ears might a been hurt<br>Or yer eyes’ve turned filthy from the sight-blindin’ dirt<br>And you figured you failed in yesterdays rush<br>When you were faked out an’ fooled white facing a four flush<br>And all the time you were holdin’ three queens<br>And it’s makin you mad, it’s makin’ you mean<br>Like in the middle of Life magazine<br>Bouncin’ around a pinball machine<br>And there’s something on yer mind you wanna be saying<br>That somebody someplace oughta be hearin’<br>But it’s trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head<br>And it bothers you badly when your layin’ in bed<br>And no matter how you try you just can’t say it<br>And yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it<br>And yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head<br>And yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead<br>And the lion’s mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth<br>And his jaws start closin with you underneath<br>And yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind<br>And you wish you’d never taken that last detour sign<br>And you say to yourself just what am I doin’<br>On this road I’m walkin’, on this trail I’m turnin’<br>On this curve I’m hanging<br>On this pathway I’m strolling, in the space I’m taking<br>In this air I’m inhaling<br>Am I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard<br>Why am I walking, where am I running<br>What am I saying, what am I knowing<br>On this guitar I’m playing, on this banjo I’m frailin’<br>On this mandolin I’m strummin’, in the song I’m singin’<br>In the tune I’m hummin’, in the words I’m writin’<br>In the words that I’m thinkin’<br>In this ocean of hours I’m all the time drinkin’<br>Who am I helping, what am I breaking<br>What am I giving, what am I taking<br>But you try with your whole soul best<br>Never to think these thoughts and never to let<br>Them kind of thoughts gain ground<br>Or make yer heart pound<br>But then again you know why they’re around<br>Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down<br>“Cause sometimes you hear’em when the night times comes creeping<br>And you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping<br>And you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin’<br>And you can’t remember for the best of yer thinking<br>If that was you in the dream that was screaming<br>And you know that it’s something special you’re needin’<br>And you know that there’s no drug that’ll do for the healin’<br>And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding<br>And you need something special<br>Yeah, you need something special all right<br>You need a fast flyin’ train on a tornado track<br>To shoot you someplace and shoot you back<br>You need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler<br>That’s been banging and booming and blowing forever<br>That knows yer troubles a hundred times over<br>You need a Greyhound bus that don’t bar no race<br>That won’t laugh at yer looks<br>Your voice or your face<br>And by any number of bets in the book<br>Will be rollin’ long after the bubblegum craze<br>You need something to open up a new door<br>To show you something you seen before<br>But overlooked a hundred times or more<br>You need something to open your eyes<br>You need something to make it known<br>That it’s you and no one else that owns<br>That spot that yer standing, that space that you’re sitting<br>That the world ain’t got you beat<br>That it ain’t got you licked<br>It can’t get you crazy no matter how many<br>Times you might get kicked<br>You need something special all right<br>You need something special to give you hope<br>But hope’s just a word<br>That maybe you said or maybe you heard<br>On some windy corner ‘round a wide-angled curve<br>But that’s what you need man, and you need it bad<br>And yer trouble is you know it too good<br>“Cause you look an’ you start getting the chills<br>“Cause you can’t find it on a dollar bill<br>And it ain’t on Macy’s window sill<br>And it ain’t on no rich kid’s road map<br>And it ain’t in no fat kid’s fraternity house<br>And it ain’t made in no Hollywood

<p>Little Maggie, by Bob Dylan (arr)</p>
<ol>
<li>Oh, where is little Maggie<br>Over yonder she stands,<br>Rifle on her shoulder,<br>Six-shooter in her hand.</li>
<li>How can I ever stand it,<br>Just to see them two blue eyes,<br>Shinin’ like some diamonds,<br>Like some diamonds in the sky.</li>
<li>Rather be in some lonely hollow<br>Where the sun don’t ever shine,<br>Than to see you be another man’s darling,<br>And to know that you’ll never be mine.</li>
<li>Well, it’s march me away to the station<br>With my suitcase in my hand,<br>Yes, march me away to the station,<br>I’m off to some far-distant land.</li>
<li>Sometimes I have a nickel,<br>And sometimes I have a dime,<br>Sometimes I have ten dollars,<br>Just to pay for little Maggie’s wine.</li>
<li>Pretty flowers are made for blooming,<br>Pretty stars are made to shine,<br>Pretty girls are made for boy’s love,<br>Little Maggie was made for mine.</li>
<li>Well, yonder stands little Maggie<br>With a dram glass in her hand,<br>She’s a drinkin’ down her troubles<br>Over courtin’ some other man.</li>

<p>Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts<br>The festival was over, the boys were all plannin’ for a fall,<br>The cabaret was quiet except for the drillin’ in the wall.<br>The curfew had been lifted and the gamblin’ wheel shut down,<br>Anyone with any sense had already left town.<br>He was standin’ in the doorway lookin’ like the Jack of Hearts.<br>He moved across the mirrored room, “Set it up for everyone,” he said,<br>Then everyone commenced to do what they were doin’ before he turned their heads.<br>Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,<br>“Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”<br>Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts.<br>Backstage the girls were playin’ five-card stud by the stairs,<br>Lily had two queens, she was hopin’ for a third to match her pair.<br>Outside the streets were fillin’ up, the window was open wide,<br>A gentle breeze was blowin’, you could feel it from inside.<br>Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts.<br>Big Jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town’s only diamond mine,<br>He made his usual entrance lookin’ so dandy and so fine.<br>With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,<br>He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste.<br>But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts.<br>Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,<br>She slipped in through the side door lookin’ like a queen without a crown.<br>She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,<br>“Sorry, darlin’, that I’m late,” but he didn’t seem to hear.<br>He was starin’ into space over at the Jack of Hearts.<br>“I know I’ve seen that face before,” Big Jim was thinkin’ to himself,<br>“Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf.”<br>But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim<br>And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,<br>Starin’ at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts.<br>Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,<br>She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.<br>She’d come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs<br>With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere.<br>But she’d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts.<br>The hangin’ judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,<br>The drillin’ in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind.<br>It was known all around that Lily had Jim’s ring<br>And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king.<br>No, nothin’ ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts.<br>Rosemary started drinkin’ hard and seein’ her reflection in the knife,<br>She was tired of the attention, tired of playin’ the role of Big Jim’s wife.<br>She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,<br>Was lookin’ to do just one good deed before she died.<br>She was gazin’ to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts.<br>Lily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away.<br>“Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you must<br>have known it would someday.<br>Be careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint,<br>I’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re lookin’ like a saint.”<br>Down the hallway footsteps were comin’ for the Jack of Hearts.<br>The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair.<br>“There’s something funny going on,” he said, “I can just feel it in the air.”<br>He went to get the hangin’ judge, but the hangin’ judge was drunk,<br>As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk.<br>There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts.<br>Lily’s arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch,<br>She forgot all about the man she couldn’t stand who hounded her so much.<br>“I’ve missed you so,” she said to him, and he felt she was sincere,<br>But just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear.<br>Just another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts.<br>No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick,<br>The door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked.<br>And Big Jim was standin’ there, ya couldn’t say surprised,<br>Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes.<br>She was with Big Jim but she was leanin’ to the Jack of Hearts.<br>Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall<br>And cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul.<br>In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground<br>For one more member who had business back in town.<br>But they couldn’t go no further without the Jack of Hearts.<br>The next day was hangin’ day, the sky was overcast and black,<br>Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back.<br>And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn’t even blink,<br>The hangin’ judge was sober, he hadn’t had a drink.<br>The only person on the scene missin’ was the Jack of Hearts.<br>The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “Closed for repair,”<br>Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.<br>She was thinkin’ ‘bout her father, who she very rarely saw,<br>Thinkin’ ‘bout Rosemary and thinkin’ about the law.<br>But, most of all she was thinkin’ ‘bout the Jack of Hearts.</p>
<p>Little Sadie<br>Went out last night to take a little round.<br>I met my little Sadie and I brought her down.<br>I ran right home and I went to bed<br>With a forty-four smokeless under my head.<br>I began to think what a deed I’d done,<br>I grabbed my hat and I began to run.<br>I made a god run but I ran too slow;<br>They overtook me down in Jericho<br>Standing on a corner ringin’ my bell,<br>Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville.<br>He said “Young man is you name Brown?<br>Remember the night you blowed Little Sadie down.”<br>“Oh, yes sir, my name is Lee.<br>I murdered little Sadie in the first degree.<br>First degree and second degree,<br>If you’ve got any papers will you serve them to me?”<br>Well they took me down town and they dressed me in black.<br>They put me on a train and they brought me back.<br>I had no one for to go my bail;<br>They crammed me back into the county jail.<br>The judge and the jury they took their stand.<br>The judge had the papers in his right hand.<br>Forty-one days, forty-one nights;<br>Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes</p>
<p>Living the Blues<br>Since you’ve been gone,<br>I’ve been walking around<br>With my head bowed down to my shoes.<br>I’ve been living the blues<br>Ev’ry night without you.<br>I don’t have to go far<br>To know where you are,<br>Strangers all give me the news.<br>I’ve been living the blues<br>Ev’ry night without you.<br>I think that it’s best,<br>I soon get some rest<br>And forget my pride.<br>But I can’t deny<br>This feeling that I<br>Carry for you deep down inside.<br>If you see me this way,<br>You’d come back and you’d stay,<br>Oh, how could you refuse.<br>I’ve been living the blues<br>Ev’ry night without you.</p>

<p>Lone Pilgrim, by B.F. White and Adger M. Pace</p>
<ol>
<li>I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay,<br>And patiently stood by his tomb,<br>When in a low whisper I heard something say:<br>How sweetly I sleep here alone.</li>
<li>The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar<br>And gathering storms may arise,<br>But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,<br>The tears are all wiped from my eyes.</li>
<li>The call of my master compelled me from home,<br>No kindred or relative nigh.<br>I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,<br>My soul flew to mansions on high.</li>
<li>Go tell my companion and children most dear<br>To weep not for me now I’m gone.<br>The same hand that led me through seas most severe<br>Has kindly assisted me home.</li>

<ol>
<li>“Get down, get down, Love Henry,” she cried.<br>“And stay all night with me.<br>I have gold chains, and the finest I have<br>I’ll apply them all to thee.”</li>
<li>“I can’t get down and I shan’t get down,<br>Or stay all night with thee.<br>Some pretty little girl in Cornersville<br>I love far better than thee.”</li>
<li>He layed his head on a pillow of down.<br>Kisses she gave him three.<br>With a penny knife that she held in her hand<br>She murdered mortal he.<br>Instrumental</li>
<li>“Get well, get well, Love Henry, “ She cried,<br>“Get well, get well,” said she.<br>“Oh don’t you see my own heart’s blood<br>Come flowin’ down so free?”</li>
<li>She took him by his long yellow hair,<br>And also by his feet.<br>She plunged him into well water, where<br>It runs both cold and deep</li>
<li>“Lie there, lie there, Love Henry,” she cried,<br>“Til the flesh rots off your bones.<br>Some pretty little girl in Cornersville<br>Will mourn for your return.”<br>Instrumental</li>
<li>“Hush up, hush up, my parrot,” she cried,<br>“And light on my right knee.<br>The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold<br>And hung on a willow tree.”</li>
<li>“I won’t fly down, I can’t fly down<br>And light on your right knee.<br>A girl who would murder her own true love<br>Would kill a little birdlike me.”</li>

<p>Love Is Just A Four-letter Word<br>Seems like only yesterday<br>I left my mind behind<br>Down in the Gypsy Cafe<br>With a friend of a friend of mine<br>She sat with a baby heavy on her knee<br>Yet spoke of life most free from slavery<br>With eyes that showed no trace of misery<br>A phrase in connection first with she I heard<br>That love is just a four-letter word<br>Outside a rambling store-front window<br>Cats meowed to the break of day<br>Me, I kept my mouth shut, too<br>To you I had no words to say<br>My experience was limited and underfed<br>You were talking while I hid<br>To the one who was the father of your kid<br>You probably didn’t think I did, but I heard<br>You say that love is just a four-letter word<br>I said goodbye unnoticed<br>Pushed towards things in my own games<br>Drifting in and out of lifetimes<br>Unmentionable by name<br>Searching for my double, looking for<br>Complete evaporation to the core<br>Though I tried and failed at finding any door<br>I must have thought that there was nothing more<br>Absurd than that love is just a four-letter word<br>Though I never knew just what you meant<br>When you were speaking to your man<br>I can only think in terms of me<br>And now I understand<br>After waking enough times to think I see<br>The Holy Kiss that’s supposed to last eternity<br>Blow up in smoke, its destiny<br>Falls on strangers, travels free<br>Yes, I know now, traps are only set by me<br>And I do not really need to be<br>Assured that love is just a four-letter word</p>
<p>Love Sick<br>I’m walking through streets that are dead<br>Walking, walking with you in my head<br>My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired<br>And the clouds are weeping<br>Did I hear someone tell a lie?<br>Did I hear someone’s distant cry?<br>I spoke like a child; you destroyed me with a smile<br>While I was sleeping<br>I’m sick of love but I’m in the thick of it<br>This kind of love I’m so sick of it<br>I see, I see lovers in the meadow<br>I see, I see silhouettes in the window<br>I watch them ‘til they’re gone and they leave me hanging on<br>To a shadow<br>I’m sick of love; I hear the clock tick<br>This kind of love; I’m love sick<br>Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder<br>Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder<br>Could you ever be true?<br>I think of you<br>And I wonder<br>I’m sick of love; I wish I’d never met you<br>I’m sick of love; I’m trying to forget you<br>Just don’t know what to do<br>I’d give anything to<br>Be with you</p>

<p>Shelter from the Storm<br>‘Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood<br>When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud<br>I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form.<br>“Come in,” she said,<br>“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”<br>And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured<br>I’ll always do my best for her, on that I give my word<br>In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm.<br>“Come in,” she said,<br>“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”<br>Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved<br>Everything up to that point had been left unresolved.<br>Try imagining a place where it’s always safe and warm.<br>“Come in,” she said,<br>“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”<br>I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,<br>Poisoned in the bushes an’ blown out on the trail,<br>Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn.<br>“Come in,” she said,<br>“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”<br>Suddenly I turned around and she was standin’ there<br>With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair.<br>She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns.<br>“Come in,” she said,<br>“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”<br>Now there’s a wall between us, somethin’ there’s been lost<br>I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed.<br>Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn.<br>“Come in,” she said,<br>“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”<br>Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount<br>But nothing really matters much, it’s doom alone that counts<br>And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn.<br>“Come in,” she said,<br>“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”<br>I’ve heard newborn babies wailin’ like a mournin’ dove<br>And old men with broken teeth stranded without love.<br>Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?<br>“Come in,” she said,<br>“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”<br>In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes<br>I bargained for salvation an’ they gave me a lethal dose.<br>I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn.<br>“Come in,” she said,<br>“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”<br>Well, I’m livin’ in a foreign country but I’m bound to cross the line<br>Beauty walks a razor’s edge, someday I’ll make it mine.<br>If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born.<br>“Come in,” she said,<br>“I’ll give you shelter from the storm.”</p>

<p>Tangled Up in Blue<br>Early one mornin’ the sun was shinin’,<br>I was layin’ in bed<br>Wond’rin’ if she’d changed at all<br>If her hair was still red.<br>Her folks they said our lives together<br>Sure was gonna be rough<br>They never did like Mama’s homemade dress<br>Papa’s bankbook wasn’t big enough.<br>And I was standin’ on the side of the road<br>Rain fallin’ on my shoes<br>Heading out for the East Coast<br>Lord knows I’ve paid some dues gettin’ through,<br>Tangled up in blue.<br>She was married when we first met<br>Soon to be divorced<br>I helped her out of a jam, I guess,<br>But I used a little too much force.<br>We drove that car as far as we could<br>Abandoned it out West<br>Split up on a dark sad night<br>Both agreeing it was best.<br>She turned around to look at me<br>As I was walkin’ away<br>I heard her say over my shoulder,<br>“We’ll meet again someday on the avenue,”<br>Tangled up in blue.<br>I had a job in the great north woods<br>Working as a cook for a spell<br>But I never did like it all that much<br>And one day the ax just fell.<br>So I drifted down to New Orleans<br>Where I happened to be employed<br>Workin’ for a while on a fishin’ boat<br>Right outside of Delacroix.<br>But all the while I was alone<br>The past was close behind,<br>I seen a lot of women<br>But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew<br>Tangled up in blue.<br>She was workin’ in a topless place<br>And I stopped in for a beer,<br>I just kept lookin’ at the side of her face<br>In the spotlight so clear.<br>And later on as the crowd thinned out<br>I’s just about to do the same,<br>She was standing there in back of my chair<br>Said to me, “Don’t I know your name?”<br>I muttered somethin’ underneath my breath,<br>She studied the lines on my face.<br>I must admit I felt a little uneasy<br>When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,<br>Tangled up in blue.<br>She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe<br>“I thought you’d never say hello,” she said<br>“You look like the silent type.”<br>Then she opened up a book of poems<br>And handed it to me<br>Written by an Italian poet<br>From the thirteenth century.<br>And every one of them words rang true<br>And glowed like burnin’ coal<br>Pourin’ off of every page<br>Like it was written in my soul from me to you,<br>Tangled up in blue.<br>I lived with them on Montague Street<br>In a basement down the stairs,<br>There was music in the cafes at night<br>And revolution in the air.<br>Then he started into dealing with slaves<br>And something inside of him died.<br>She had to sell everything she owned<br>And froze up inside.<br>And when finally the bottom fell out<br>I became withdrawn,<br>The only thing I knew how to do<br>Was to keep on keepin’ on like a bird that flew,<br>Tangled up in blue.<br>So now I’m goin’ back again,<br>I got to get to her somehow.<br>All the people we used to know<br>They’re an illusion to me now.<br>Some are mathematicians<br>Some are carpenter’s wives.<br>Don’t know how it all got started,<br>I don’t know what they’re doin’ with their lives.<br>But me, I’m still on the road<br>Headin’ for another joint<br>We always did feel the same,<br>We just saw it from a different point of view,<br>Tangled up in blue.</p>

<p>The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest<br>Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest,<br>They were the best of friends.<br>So when Frankie Lee needed money one day,<br>Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens<br>And placed them on a footstool<br>Just above the plotted plain,<br>Sayin’, “Take your pick, Frankie Boy,<br>My loss will be your gain.”<br>Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down<br>And put his fingers to his chin,<br>But with the cold eyes of Judas on him,<br>His head began to spin.<br>“Would ya please not stare at me like that,” he said,<br>“It’s just my foolish pride,<br>But sometimes a man must be alone<br>And this is no place to hide.”<br>Well, Judas, he just winked and said,<br>“All right, I’ll leave you here,<br>But you’d better hurry up and choose<br>Which of those bills you want,<br>Before they all disappear.”<br>“I’m gonna start my pickin’ right now,<br>Just tell me where you’ll be.”<br>Judas pointed down the road<br>And said, “Eternity!”<br>“Eternity?” said Frankie Lee,<br>With a voice as cold as ice.<br>“That’s right,” said Judas Priest, “Eternity,<br>Though you might call it ‘Paradise.’”<br>“I don’t call it anything,”<br>Said Frankie Lee with a smile.<br>“All right,” said Judas Priest,<br>“I’ll see you after a while.”<br>Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down,<br>Feelin’ low and mean,<br>When just then a passing stranger<br>Burst upon the scene,<br>Saying, “Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler,<br>Whose father is deceased?<br>Well, if you are,<br>There’s a fellow callin’ you down the road<br>And they say his name is Priest.”<br>“Oh, yes, he is my friend,”<br>Said Frankie Lee in fright,<br>“I do recall him very well,<br>In fact, he just left my sight.”<br>“Yes, that’s the one,” said the stranger,<br>As quiet as a mouse,<br>“Well, my message is, he’s down the road,<br>Stranded in a house.”<br>Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked,<br>He dropped ev’rything and ran<br>Until he came up to the spot<br>Where Judas Priest did stand.<br>“What kind of house is this,” he said,<br>“Where I have come to roam?”<br>“It’s not a house,” said Judas Priest,<br>“It’s not a house . . . it’s a home.”<br>Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled,<br>He soon lost all control<br>Over ev’rything which he had made<br>While the mission bells did toll.<br>He just stood there staring<br>At that big house as bright as any sun,<br>With four and twenty windows<br>And a woman’s face in ev’ry one.<br>Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee<br>With a soulful, bounding leap,<br>And, foaming at the mouth,<br>He began to make his midnight creep.<br>For sixteen nights and days he raved,<br>But on the seventeenth he burst<br>Into the arms of Judas Priest,<br>Which is where he died of thirst.<br>No one tried to say a thing<br>When they took him out in jest,<br>Except, of course, the little neighbor boy<br>Who carried him to rest.<br>And he just walked along, alone,<br>With his guilt so well concealed,<br>And muttered underneath his breath,<br>“Nothing is revealed.”<br>Well, the moral of the story,<br>The moral of this song,<br>Is simply that one should never be<br>Where one does not belong.<br>So when you see your neighbor carryin’ somethin’,<br>Help him with his load,<br>And don’t go mistaking Paradise<br>For that home across the road.</p>
<p>The Death Of Emmett Till<br>“Twas down in Mississippi no so long ago,<br>When a young boy from Chicago town stepped through a Southern door.<br>This boy’s dreadful tragedy I can still remember well,<br>The color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till.<br>Some men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up.<br>They said they had a reason, but I can’t remember what.<br>They tortured him and did some evil things too evil to repeat.<br>There was screaming sounds inside the barn, there was laughing sounds out on the street.<br>Then they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rain<br>And they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain.<br>The reason that they killed him there, and I’m sure it ain’t no lie,<br>Was just for the fun of killin’ him and to watch him slowly die.<br>And then to stop the United States of yelling for a trial,<br>Two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till.<br>But on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this awful crime,<br>And so this trial was a mockery, but nobody seemed to mind.<br>I saw the morning papers but I could not bear to see<br>The smiling brothers walkin’ down the courthouse stairs.<br>For the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free,<br>While Emmett’s body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea.<br>If you can’t speak out against this kind of thing, a crime that’s so unjust,<br>Your eyes are filled with dead men’s dirt, your mind is filled with dust.<br>Your arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains, and your blood it must refuse to flow,<br>For you let this human race fall down so God-awful low!<br>This song is just a reminder to remind your fellow man<br>That this kind of thing still lives today in that ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan.<br>But if all of us folks that thinks alike, if we gave all we could give,<br>We could make this great land of ours a greater place to live.</p>

<p>Visions of Johanna<br>Ain’t it just like the night to play tricks when you’re tryin’ to be so quiet?<br>We sit here stranded, though we’re all doin’ our best to deny it<br>And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin’ you to defy it<br>Lights flicker from the opposite loft<br>In this room the heat pipes just cough<br>The country music station plays soft<br>But there’s nothing, really nothing to turn off<br>Just Louise and her lover so entwined<br>And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind<br>In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman’s bluff with the key chain<br>And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the “D” train<br>We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight<br>Ask himself if it’s him or them that’s really insane<br>Louise, she’s all right, she’s just near<br>She’s delicate and seems like the mirror<br>But she just makes it all too concise and too clear<br>That Johanna’s not here<br>The ghost of ‘lectricity howls in the bones of her face<br>Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place<br>Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously<br>He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously<br>And when bringing her name up<br>He speaks of a farewell kiss to me<br>He’s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all<br>Muttering small talk at the wall while I’m in the hall<br>How can I explain?<br>Oh, it’s so hard to get on<br>And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn<br>Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial<br>Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while<br>But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues<br>You can tell by the way she smiles<br>See the primitive wallflower freeze<br>When the jelly-faced women all sneeze<br>Hear the one with the mustache say, “Jeeze<br>I can’t find my knees”<br>Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule<br>But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel<br>The peddler now speaks to the countess who’s pretending to care for him<br>Sayin’, “Name me someone that’s not a parasite and I’ll go out and say a prayer for him”<br>But like Louise always says<br>“Ya can’t look at much, can ya man?”<br>As she, herself, prepares for him<br>And Madonna, she still has not showed<br>We see this empty cage now corrode<br>Where her cape of the stage once had flowed<br>The fiddler, he now steps to the road<br>He writes ev’rything’s been returned which was owed<br>On the back of the fish truck that loads<br>While my conscience explodes<br>The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain<br>And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain</p>
<p>Walkin’ Down the Line<br>Well, I’m walkin’ down the line,<br>I’m walkin’ down the line<br>An’ I’m walkin’ down the line.<br>My feet’ll be a-flyin’<br>To tell about my troubled mind.<br>I got a heavy-headed gal<br>I got a heavy-headed gal<br>I got a heavy-headed gal<br>She ain’t feelin’ well<br>When she’s better only time will tell<br>Well, I’m walkin’ down the line,<br>I’m walkin’ down the line<br>An’ I’m walkin’ down the line.<br>My feet’ll be a-flyin’<br>To tell about my troubled mind.<br>My money comes and goes<br>My money comes and goes<br>My money comes and goes<br>And rolls and flows and rolls and flows<br>Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes<br>Well, I’m walkin’ down the line,<br>I’m walkin’ down the line<br>An’ I’m walkin’ down the line.<br>My feet’ll be a-flyin’<br>To tell about my troubled mind.<br>I see the morning light<br>I see the morning light<br>Well it’s not because<br>I’m an early riser<br>I didn’t go to sleep last night<br>Well, I’m walkin’ down the line,<br>I’m walkin’ down the line<br>An’ I’m walkin’ down the line.<br>My feet’ll be a-flyin’<br>To tell about my troubled mind.<br>I got my walkin’ shoes<br>I got my walkin’ shoes<br>I got my walkin’ shoes<br>An’ I ain’t a-gonna lose<br>I believe I got the walkin’ blues<br>Well, I’m walkin’ down the line,<br>I’m walkin’ down the line<br>An’ I’m walkin’ down the line.<br>My feet’ll be a-flyin’<br>To tell about my troubled mind.</p>
<p>Walk Out In The Rain, by Bob Dylan and Helena Springs<br>Walk out if it doesn’t feel right,<br>I can tell you’re only lying.<br>If you got something better tonight,<br>Don’t mess up my mind with your crying.<br>Walk out in the rain,<br>Walk out with your dreams,<br>Walk out of my life<br>If it doesn’t feel right<br>And catch the next train.<br>Oh, darling, walk out in the rain.<br>I have come from so far away<br>Just to put a ring on your finger.<br>You’ve said all that you’ve got to say,<br>So please don’t feel the need to linger.<br>Walk out in the rain,<br>Walk out with your dreams,<br>Walk out of my life<br>If it doesn’t feel right<br>And catch the next train.<br>Oh, darling, walk out in the rain.<br>It’s rainin’ inside of the city,<br>My poor feet have walked ‘til they’re sore.<br>If you don’t want my love, it’s a pity,<br>I guess I can’t see you no more.<br>Walk out in the rain,<br>Walk out with your dreams,<br>Walk out of my life<br>If it doesn’t feel right<br>And catch the next train.<br>Oh, darling, walk out in the rain.</p>

<p>We Better Talk This Over<br>I think we better talk this over<br>Maybe when we both get sober<br>You’ll understand I’m only a man<br>Doin’ the best that I can.<br>This situation can only get rougher.<br>Why should we needlessly suffer?<br>Let’s call it a day, go our own different ways<br>Before we decay.<br>You don’t have to be afraid of looking into my face,<br>We’ve done nothing to each other time will not erase.<br>I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling<br>You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.<br>I took a chance, got caught in the trance<br>Of a downhill dance.<br>Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?<br>I’m exiled, you can’t convert me.<br>I’m lost in the haze of your delicate ways<br>With both eyes glazed.<br>You don’t have to yearn for love, you don’t have to be alone,<br>Somewheres in this universe there’s a place that you can call home.<br>I guess I’ll be leaving tomorrow<br>If I have to beg, steal or borrow.<br>It’d be great to cross paths in a day and a half<br>Look at each other and laugh.<br>But I don’t think it’s liable to happen<br>Like the sound of one hand clappin’.<br>The vows that we kept are now broken and swept<br>‘Neath the bed where we slept.<br>Don’t think of me and fantasize on what we never had,<br>Be grateful for what we’ve shared together and be glad.<br>Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?<br>Eventually we’ll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.<br>Oh, babe, time for a new transition<br>I wish I was a magician.<br>I would wave a wand and tie back the bond<br>That we’ve both gone beyond.</p>

<p>Wedding Song<br>I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,<br>I love you more than money and more than the stars above,<br>Love you more than madness, more than waves upon the sea,<br>Love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.<br>Ever since you walked right in, the circle’s been complete,<br>I’ve said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,<br>To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun,<br>I love you more than ever and I haven’t yet begun.<br>You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,<br>When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give,<br>Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole,<br>Quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul.<br>You gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life,<br>Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,<br>My thoughts of you don’t ever rest, they’d kill me if I lie,<br>I’d sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die.<br>The tune tat is yours and mine to play upon this earth,<br>We’ll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth,<br>What’s lost is lost, we can’t regain what went down in the flood,<br>But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.<br>It’s never been my duty to remake the world at large,<br>Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge,<br>‘Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn’t bend,<br>And if there is eternity I’d love you there again.<br>Oh, can’t you see that you were born to stand by my side<br>And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride,<br>You’re the other half of what I am, you’re the missing piece<br>And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn’t cease.<br>You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,<br>Just bein’ next to you is a natural thing for me<br>And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,<br>‘Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.</p>
<p>Went to See the Gypsy<br>Went to see the gypsy,<br>Stayin’ in a big hotel.<br>He smiled when he saw me coming,<br>And he said, “Well, well, well.”<br>His room was dark and crowded,<br>Lights were low and dim.<br>“How are you?” he said to me,<br>I said it back to him.<br>I went down to the lobby<br>To make a small call out.<br>A pretty dancing girl was there,<br>And she began to shout,<br>“Go on back to see the gypsy.<br>He can move you from the rear,<br>Drive you from your fear,<br>Bring you through the mirror.<br>He did it in Las Vegas,<br>And he can do it here.”<br>Outside the lights were shining<br>On the river of tears,<br>I watched them from the distance<br>With music in my ears.<br>I went back to see the gypsy,<br>It was nearly early dawn.<br>The gypsy’s door was open wide<br>But the gypsy was gone,<br>And that pretty dancing girl,<br>She could not be found.<br>So I watched that sun come rising<br>From that little Minnesota town.</p>
<p>What Good Am I?<br>What good am I if I’m like all the rest,<br>If I just turned away, when I see how you’re dressed,<br>If I shut myself off so I can’t hear you cry,<br>What good am I?<br>What good am I if I know and don’t do,<br>If I see and don’t say, if I look right through you,<br>If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin’ sky,<br>What good am I?<br>What good am I while you softly weep<br>And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep,<br>And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don’t try,<br>What good am I?<br>What good am I then to others and me<br>If I’ve had every chance and yet still fail to see<br>Bridge: If my hands tied must I not wonder within<br>Who tied them and why and where must I have been<br>What good am I if I say foolish things<br>And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings<br>And I just turn my back while you silently die,<br>What good am I?</p>
<p> When He Returns<br>The iron hand it ain’t no match for the iron rod,<br>The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty God.<br>For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears<br>It is only He who can reduce me to tears.<br>Don’t you cry and don’t you die and don’t you burn<br>For like a thief in the night, He’ll replace wrong with right<br>When He returns.<br>Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,<br>He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.<br>How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?<br>How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?<br>Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?<br>Will I ever learn that there’ll be no peace, that the war won’t cease<br>Until He returns?<br>Surrender your crown on this blood-stained ground, take off your mask,<br>He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.<br>How long can you falsify and deny what is real?<br>How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?<br>Of every earthly plan that be known to man, He is unconcerned,<br>He’s got plans of His own to set up His throne<br>When He returns.</p>

<p>Where Are You Tonight?<br>There’s a long-distance train rolling through the rain, tears on the letter I write.<br>There’s a woman I long to touch and I miss her so much but she’s drifting like a<br>satellite. There’s a neon light ablaze in this green smoky haze, laughter down on<br>Elizabeth Street<br>And a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone where she bathed in a stream of pure<br>heat. Her father would emphasize you got to be more than street-wise but he practiced<br>what he preached from the heart.<br>A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted to me the time and the place that the trouble would start.<br>There’s a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage<br>And a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage<br>And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page<br>Of a book that no one can write.<br>Oh, where are you tonight?<br>The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure, to live it you have to explode.<br>In that last hour of need, we entirely agreed, sacrifice was the code of the road.<br>I left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John, strong men belittled by doubt.<br>I couldn’t tell her what my private thoughts were but she had some way of finding<br>them out. He took dead-center aim but he missed just the same, she was waiting,<br>putting flowers on the shelf.<br>She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair and discovered her invisible self.<br>There’s a lion in the road, there’s a demon escaped,<br>There’s a million dreams gone, there’s a landscape being raped,<br>As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape,<br>I won’t, but then again, maybe I might.<br>Oh, if I could just find you tonight.<br>I fought with my twin, that enemy within, ‘til both of us fell by the way.<br>Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees while the law looks the other way.<br>Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes, the guy you were lovin’<br>couldn’t stay clean.<br>It felt outa place, my foot in his face, but he should-a stayed where his money was<br>green.<br>I bit into the root of forbidden fruit with the juice running down my leg.<br>Then I dealt with your boss, who’d never known about loss and who always was<br>too proud to beg.<br>There’s a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room and a pathway that leads<br>up to the stars.<br>If you don’t believe there’s a price for this sweet paradise, remind me to show you the<br>scars.<br>There’s a new day at dawn and I’ve finally arrived.<br>If I’m there in the morning, baby, you’ll know I’ve survived.<br>I can’t believe it, I can’t believe I’m alive,<br>But without you it just doesn’t seem right.<br>Oh, where are you tonight?</p>

<p>You’re a Big Girl Now<br>Our conversation was short and sweet<br>It nearly swept me off-a my feet.<br>And I’m back in the rain, oh, oh,<br>And you are on dry land.<br>You made it there somehow<br>You’re a big girl now.<br>Bird on the horizon, sittin’ on a fence,<br>He’s singin’ his song for me at his own expense.<br>And I’m just like that bird, oh, oh,<br>Singin’ just for you.<br>I hope that you can hear,<br>Hear me singin’ through these tears.<br>Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast<br>Oh, but what a shame if all we’ve shared can’t last.<br>I can change, I swear, oh, oh,<br>See what you can do.<br>I can make it through,<br>You can make it too.<br>Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,<br>You’ve known it all the time, I’m learnin’ it these days.<br>Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh,<br>In somebody’s room.<br>It’s a price I have to pay<br>You’re a big girl all the way.<br>A change in the weather is known to be extreme<br>But what’s the sense of changing horses in midstream?<br>I’m going out of my mind, oh, oh,<br>With a pain that stops and starts<br>Like a corkscrew to my heart<br>Ever since we’ve been apart.</p>
<p>You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go<br>I’ve seen love go by my door<br>It’s never been this close before<br>Never been so easy or so slow.<br>Been shooting in the dark too long<br>When somethin’s not right it’s wrong<br>Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.<br>Dragon clouds so high above<br>I’ve only known careless love,<br>It’s always hit me from below.<br>This time around it’s more correct<br>Right on target, so direct,<br>Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.<br>Purple clover, Queen Anne lace,<br>Crimson hair across your face,<br>You could make me cry if you don’t know.<br>Can’t remember what I was thinkin’ of<br>You might be spoilin’ me too much, love,<br>Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.<br>Flowers on the hillside, bloomin’ crazy,<br>Crickets talkin’ back and forth in rhyme,<br>Blue river runnin’ slow and lazy,<br>I could stay with you forever<br>And never realize the time.<br>Situations have ended sad,<br>Relationships have all been bad.<br>Mine’ve been like Verlaine’s and Rimbaud.<br>But there’s no way I can compare<br>All those scenes to this affair,<br>Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go.<br>Yer gonna make me wonder what I’m doin’,<br>Stayin’ far behind without you.<br>Yer gonna make me wonder what I’m sayin’,<br>Yer gonna make me give myself a good talkin’ to.<br>I’ll look for you in old Honolulu,<br>San Francisco, Ashtabula,<br>Yer gonna have to leave me now, I know.<br>But I’ll see you in the sky above,<br>In the tall grass, in the ones I love,<br>Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go</p>
